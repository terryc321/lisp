<h2>Getting Started</h2>

This chapter will provide you with some experience in using the
P-Lisp system. Its purpose is to help you become familiar with the
basic operation of the language. 
<p>We assume that you are sitting in front of your computer, with
Lisp up and running [see the explanation of how to do this in the
<em>P-Lisp Manual</em>]. You should see the following at the top of
the screen:</p>

When you see this display it means that you have successfully
entered Lisp. The ":" prompt that you see on the last line typed by
the computer means that Lisp is waiting for you to type something
in. You may type in what you wish. After you hit the RETURN key
Lisp will evaluate your command and display the result. This
process of "read-evaluate-print" result constitutes the core of the
interactive Lisp system. We will see more or READ-EVALUATE-PRINT
much later on. 
<p>Note that if you hit RETURN several times, each time Lisp will
respond with the ":". You told it to do nothing, so it did nothing
and then asked for another line of input.</p>

<p>If we type a number, then Lisp will echo the number back. All of
our inputs follow the ":" prompt; all of Lisp's responses are
preceded by two spaces.</p>

<pre>
:3

  3

:0

  0

:-2

  -2
</pre>

<a name="add"></a> Let's try an example: adding up some numbers. To
add numbers in Lisp we use the ADD function. We add 1 and 2 by
typing: 
<pre>
:(ADD 1 2)

  3
</pre>

Yeah! Lisp can add. What actually happened? Lisp typed the ":" and
then we typed "(add 1 2)". Note several things: 
<ul>
<li>The word ADD and the numbers "1" and "2" are separated by
spaces [blanks].</li>

<li>We surrounded the expression with parentheses. Parentheses are
an integral part of the Lisp language, so you will soon learn to
love parentheses [we hope].</li>

<li>Lisp responded immediately with the answer. Lisp is an
interactive system, and it will always display the answer
immediately, unless you tell it otherwise. Later we will see how to
tell it otherwise.</li>
</ul>

Let's try some more addition. 
<pre>
:(ADD 12 3

:)

  15

:(ADD 1)

    ** ERROR: TOO FEW ARGS **
      ADD :: (1 )

+()

  NIL

:(ADD 11 8 3)

    ** ERROR: TOO MANY ARGS **
      ADD :: (11 8 3 )

+()

  NIL
</pre>

Here we first try the same example but we have forgotten the
closing parenthesis. Lisp is waiting for that closing parenthesis
so it comes back with a ":" prompt. We enter the closing
parentheses, and now Lisp is happy, so it performs the addition. In
general, you may spread the input across as many lines as you like.
Later this will be quite useful. 
<p>The next line shows something a little funny. We asked Lisp to
add up one number. Because adding up just one number is not
particularly meaningful or useful, Lisp returns an error message
that there are too few numbers to add. This is quite reasonable,
since you usually want to add up at least two numbers.</p>

<p>Note that Lisp now gives us a "+" instead of the usual ":".
Don't worry about this for now, simply type "()". We will deal with
this mode of operation later.</p>

<p>The last line shows what happens if you try to add up three
numbers--the same sort of error! Well, there is no penalty for
mistakes [we won't tell]. It makes a little more sense to add up
more than two numbers than it did to add up just one number. We'll
see much later that we can actually fix ADD ourselves to do this
[or any other sort of behavior that we like].</p>

<a name="argsname"></a> 
<p>The first thing in a pair of parentheses is the
<em>function</em> name and the things after that are the
<em>arguments</em> [thus the statement "TOO FEW ARGS" in the above
error report]. This is very important, and these two words will be
used throughout this book. In the first example above the function
name is ADD and its arguments are "1" and "2". ADD is said to have
two arguments in this example.</p>
<a name="mult"></a>
<p>Besides addition, Lisp can also perform multiplication. The name
of the multiplication function is MULT. Let's try it out!</p>

<pre>
:(MULT 2 3)

  6

:(MULT 9 2)

  18

:(MULT 1 2 3 4)

    ** ERROR: TOO MANY ARGS **
      MULT :: (1 2 3 4 )

+()

  NIL

:(MULT 1.2 4)

  4.8

:(MULT 2 (ADD 1 2))

  6
</pre>

The first two examples reassure us that Lisp can, in fact,
multiply. 
<p>Lisp can, however, multiply only two values. If you try and
multiply more than two values, you will get a TOO MANY ARGS error.
By the way, if you try and use MULT with zero or one argument, you
will get a TOO FEW ARGS error. Again, we type "()"" to get back to
the normal colon prompt.</p>

<p>The next example shows that Lisp will deal with non-integers.
Floating point math is nice, but not critical because, as we will
soon see, Lisp's strength does not lie in arithmetic.</p>
<a name="subexpr"></a>
<p>The last of the above lines is the most interesting. Lisp tries
to perform the MULT function but finds that in place of the second
argument is a <em>subexpression</em>. The value of the
subexpression "(add 1 2)" is, of course, 3. There is now a number
to take the place of the subexpression so the multiplication can
continue. Lisp now effectively sees "(mult 2 3)" which it
performs.</p>

<p>Since this type of operation is very common in Lisp work, we are
going to try some more examples like the last one. See if you can
figure out what is happening in each expression.</p>

<pre>
:(ADD (MULT 3 4) (MULT 2 6))

  24

:(MULT (MULT (ADD 1 0) (ADD 1 1)) (MULT (ADD 2 1) (ADD 1 3)))

  24

:(MULT 1 (MULT 2 (MULT 3 (MULT 4 1)))))))))))

  24
</pre>

One important thing to notice about these examples is that in the
last one there were too many closing parentheses. This is fine and,
in fact is very handy sometimes when you lose count. All you need
to do is keep typing lots of closing parentheses and eventually
you'll get back to the colon prompt. 
<a name="pred"></a>
<p>Now for one more concept: <em>predicates</em>. A predicate is a
special kind of function that returns an answer of either true or
false. In Lisp, true is represented as "T" and false is represented
as "NIL". So, let's ask some questions.</p>

<a name="greaternumber"></a> 
<pre>
:(GREATER 3 4)

  NIL

:(GREATER 4 3)

  T

:(GREATER 100 -100)

  T

:(NUMBER 47)

  T

:(NUMBER 'LETTERS)

  NIL

:(NUMBER 'SEVEN')

  NIL
<a name="zero"></a>
:(ZERO 0)

  T

:(ZERO (ADD 2 -1))

  NIL

:(ZERO (ADD 2 -2))

  T
</pre>

The predicate GREATER returns a true "T" if the numbers are in a
strictly decreasing order; false, "NIL", otherwise. The predicate
NUMBER says "T" if the argument is a number, "NIL", otherwise.
Obviously the word "seven" is characters [more on what that quote
in front of it means later] and is not a number. ZERO returns "T"
if the argument evaluates to zero. 
<h3>Finger Exercises</h3>

Practice starting Lisp and typing in expressions. You might
actually take the time to do all of the examples in this chapter.
Also, do some math and make sure that Lisp can do math as well as
you can. See if you can come up with a way of changing algebraic
expressions into the equivalent Lisp mathematical expressions.
