<h2>The Lisp Editor ED</h2>

In the previous chapters, you were at the mercy of your typing
ability. If you could type your Lisp function in correctly the
first time, then more power to you. However, for the rest of us,
even if we do manage to get the parentheses balanced, our functions
usually don't work perfectly from the outset. Provided with Lisp is
a mechanism for manipulating user defined functions. It is called
ED, and it is designed to edit functions. 
<p>You get into the editor by typing</p>

<pre>
:(ed fun)
</pre>

<p>where FUN is the name of the function you want to edit. The
editor will respond with a level indicator and a <em>point of
view</em> [POV]. This will typically look something like this:</p>

<pre>
TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; &amp;)
</pre>

<a name="win"></a> 
<p>The point of view is a window into the function. That is, you
are always looking [through the eyes of the editor] at some
particular part of the function body and the point of view is a
picture of that part of the function.</p>

<p>Let's define a little function in order to play with the editor.
Here is the function EDITME:</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (EDITME (LAMBDA (L)

:   (PRINT (CAR L))))))))

  EDITME
</pre>

<a name="level"></a> Here is what happens when we try and edit the
function. 
<pre>
:(ED EDITME)
  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

The editor responds by displaying the top level of the LAMBDA list.
<a name="amp"></a> Any atoms [in this case only LAMBDA] are fully
spelled out, but any lists are represented by a &amp;. The reason
for this is that many lists are quite large; you would not want to
see the entire list, only enough to give you an idea of where you
are. <a name="ppov"></a> 
<p>The rule to remember in editing parts of lists is, "what you see
is what you edit". Whenever you do anything in the editor, you are
shown the current expression [the POV]. If you want to see the
entire POV without the &amp;, type a P. This will invoke the
pretty-printer on the current POV. The pretty-printer shows you
what the entire window looks like and tries to indent its elements
in some reasonable manner.</p>

<pre>
?P

  ( LAMBDA (L )
    (PRINT (CAR L ) )
  )

  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

<a name="number"></a> 
<p>We can change our location in the list [that is, change the POV
so that it indicates a different part of the list] by entering a
number as the editor command. The number is the position in the
current window to which you would like to move. Lists are numbered
like this:</p>

<pre>
(LAMBDA (L) (PRINT (CAR L)))
------- --- ----------------
   1     2         3
</pre>

<p>If we want to make the first element the new current expression
we can simply type</p>

<pre>
?2
  TOP:2: (L )
</pre>

Use "0" to move back one level. 
<pre>
?0
  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

We cannot go to 1, because the window isn't allowed to be just a
lone atom. You can only go to a list, which shows up in the window
as an &amp;. Notice that the numbering changes once we move to a
new part of the list. 
<pre>
?-1
   TOP:3:  (PRINT &amp;)
</pre>

Negative numbers can be used to move down into the function, but
the elements are counted from the right end. Therefore, we can
number the current expression as follows: 
<pre>
(PRINT  (CAR L))
------  --------
  -2       -1

?-1
   TOP:3:2:  (CAR L)
?-3
   INVALID ELEMENT.
</pre>

We cannot go to something that doesn't exist, and the editor will
report this to you. Let's go back to the top. 
<pre>
?0
   TOP:3:  (PRINT &amp;)
?0
   TOP:  (LAMBDA &amp; &amp;)
?0
   NO UP FROM HERE.
</pre>

If you also try to go past the top, of course the editor stops you.
<a name="gobxnx"></a> 
<p>There are also provisions for moving BACK one element and to the
NEXT element. These commands are BX and NX respectively. The last
movement command is GO (LEVEL INDICATOR). Regardless of where you
are, this will move you to a completely new place. Make sure the
argument to GO is a list. Let's see how these work.</p>

<pre>
?2
   TOP:2:  (L)
?NX
   TOP:3:  (PRINT &amp;)
?GO(2)
   TOP:2:  (L)
</pre>

Something funny will happen if the NX or BK are asked to go to
atoms. The editor won't let an atom be the only thing in the
window, but by jumping NX or BK you might be asking it to make an
atom the current window. Well, the editor is smarter than that. It
will skip over atoms that are in the way when BK or NX are done. <a
name="insert"></a> 
<p>So far all we've done is move around within the function. Now,
let's try and change something. To do this, we need to use the
"insert" command. Remember that editing commands only modify the
window. Make sure that what you want to modify is there. Move
around until you are looking at the correct section of the
function.</p>

<pre>
?0
  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; &amp; )

?I NOT AFTER 2
  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; NOT &amp; )

?I ONLY BEFORE -1
  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; NOT ONLY &amp; )

?I WAS FOR 1
  TOP: (WAS &amp; NOT ONLY &amp; )
</pre>

Note the three different forms of the insert ["I"] command. You can
insert AFTER an element, BEFORE an element, or FOR an element.
These three can all be abbreviated to a single letter each [A, B,
or F]. You are also not restricted to inserting just atoms either.
You can insert full lists. 
<pre>
?I (NOT) FOR 3
  TOP: (WAS &amp; &amp; ONLY &amp; )
</pre>

<a name="delete"></a> There is also a delete command for removing
items from a list. 
<pre>
'D -2
  TOP: (WAS &amp; &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

Again, for the delete command, you can use either positive or
negative numbers. <a name="abort"></a> 
<p>Using the insert and delete commands we can perform any list
surgery we want. Feeling very confident in our abilities, let's try
to fix up a real function. First, we must leve the editor by typing
ABORT. ABORT will completely ignore any changes we have made, but
since we just made a wreck of EDITME, that's perfectly
acceptable.</p>

<pre>
?ABORT

  EDIT ABORTED.
</pre>

Now, we must enter the definition of the function. It may already
be there, but you should re-enter it anyway. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (ENDS (LAMBDA (L)

:   (CONC (FIRST L) (LAST L))))))))

  ENDS
</pre>

Now, let's go back into the editor. 
<pre>
:(ED ENDS)
  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

We have loaded the function into the editor, so let's get started
by looking at the whole function. 
<pre>
?P

  ( LAMBDA (L )
    (CONC (FIRST L ) (LAST L ) )
  )

  TOP: (LAMBDA &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

Great. Let's move down the function. 
<pre>
?3
  TOP:3: (CONC &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

Now, remember what we have to do. We have to make (FIRST L) the new
list (MAKELIST (FIRST L)), and the list (LAST L) the new list
(MAKELIST (LAST L)). In English, we have to make a list out of an
atom. 
<pre>
?I (MAKELIST (FIRST L) ) FOR 2
  TOP:3: (CONC &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

OH NO! No visible change! Did it work? Why does it still say CONC
&amp; &amp;? Yes, it worked. We can use the pretty-printer to
verify this. 
<pre>
?P

  (CONC (MAKELIST (FIRST L ) ) (LAST L ) )


  TOP:3: (CONC &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

Okay. We still have one more to do, so let's do it. 
<pre>
?I (MAKELIST (LAST L)) F -1
  TOP:3: (CONC &amp; &amp; )
</pre>

<a name="exit"></a> Note the use of the F for the "for" option. As
we said, all three options can be abbreviated to just the first
letter. Now, all that we have to do is leave the editor and save
the modified function. EXIT will do both for us. 
<pre>
?EXIT

  NIL
</pre>

Not that we don't trust our work, but why don't we test the
function just to be sure. 
<pre>
:(ENDS '(AUNT EDNA IS A PICKY EATER)))

  (AUNT EATER )
:
:(ENDS '(SO YOU THINK YOU ARE FUNNY)))

  (SO FUNNY )
</pre>

<a name="pprint"></a> Looks like it worked. That sumps up the
editor commands. Don't forget that the editor is written in Lisp,
so you should feel free to look at it and play with it. The code
for the whole editor is shown in an appendix to this text.
Sometimes it's useful to just look at a function without having to
go all the way into the editor. You can get to the pretty printer
from outside ED by using the PPRINT function. Just say 
<pre>
:(pprint fun)
</pre>

where "fun" is the name of the function. It will display the
function on your screen in a neat form. 
<h3>THE EDITOR AS A LISP PROGRAM</h3>

In the appendix we have included the entire text of the Lisp
editor. It is all written in Lisp. After reading through the rest
of the book, you should definitely try to understand how the editor
functions. This will probably be the most valuable exercise that we
offer in this book. The editor is a very complicated Lisp system
and although it certainly isn't an artificial intelligence
application of Lisp, it is a very useful one.
