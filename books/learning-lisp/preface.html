<h2>Preface</h2>

This book is a primer on Lisp programming. It is written for any
student wishing to gain a basic proficiency in Lisp, regardless of
his or her background in computing. In general, the level of
discussion is appropriate for any high school student, college
student, or computer professional. A knowledge of elementary
calculus will make some of the later examples easier to understand
but is by no means required for the rest of the book. 
<p>The book was written originally by Jeff Shrager (currently at
Carnegie-Mellon University) and Steve Bagley (currently at MIT)
while they were undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania.
The Moore School Computing Facility, in the School of Engineering
and Applied Science, at the University of Pennsylvania supplied
computer time so that it could be developed online. Additional
material was contributed by Stewart Schiffman of the Gnosis staff,
and by Steve Cherry, author of P-LISP, which is the dialect of Lisp
that the examples in this book use.</p>

<h3>WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN LISP?</h3>

Lisp is important. Lisp is one of the oldest languages still in
active use. It was invented for and is still used (workshipped) by
computer scientists in "artificial intelligence". AI, as it is
called, is an area of active computer science research. For this
work, Lisp is indispensable. 
<p>Lisp is simple. Many computer languages force the user to deal
with messy details of the computer on which they are run. In Lisp
you don't worry about the mechanism of the computer. Also, the
syntax, or format, of Lisp expressions is regular and
consistent.</p>

<p>Lisp is fun. The types of problems usually dealt with in Lisp
often include games and puzzles. Also, Lisp sessions are completely
interactive. This interaction gives the user a greater sense of
control over the machine, and makes the computer more of a "partner
in thinking". Don't forget that for many years all computer systems
were "batch," which meant that jobs had to be submitted on punched
cards. The computer that P-Lisp runs on is substantially more
powerful and vastly easier to use than most of those early
machines.</p>

<h4>A SHORT HISTORY OF LISP</h4>

Lisp was developed in the late 1950s by John McCarthy at MIT to
serve as an algebraic list-processing language (LISP-LISt
Processor) for work in the then-new field of artificial
intelligence. The first work on implementation began in 1958 and
Lisp 1 was born. A second version, called Lisp 1.5, was completed
in the next few years. Lisp 1.5 is the precursor of most of the
Lisp systems in existence today. During the 1960s several other
versions were developed across the country for various different
machines. MacLisp from MIT, InterLisp, formerly BBN Lisp, and
MTSLisp from the University of Michigan are three currently
available. 
<p>The dialect spoken in this book is P-Lisp. This is yet another
Lisp system, but this one runs on the Apple and various other
microcomputer systems. Personal Lisp computers are a net innovation
in the computer world. MIT has big microcomputers that run a
MacLisp derivative. Although P-Lisp isn't as powerful as those
microcomputers (primarily because the computers it runs on are much
smaller), the ideal of having your own Lisp processor remains. In
particular, this version of the book goes with P-Lisp version 3.1.
If you don't have that version, some minor details will be
different (for example, there may not be any floating point
arithmetic).</p>

<p>If you are using another dialect of Lisp, you shouldn't have too
many problems. In most of the examples, we use a fairly common
subset of Lisp functions.</p>

<h4>THE STYLE OF THE BOOK</h4>

We believe learning should be fun, and this book is written with
that philosophy in mind. Thus, at times, we resort to using "cute"
examples to keep you from becoming bored with dry material. 
<p>We have tried to minimize the difficulties associated with some
of the more abstract concepts in Lisp by working up to them from
elementary, concrete examples. We suggest that you carefully follow
through all the examples presented. Access to your computer is
desiderable so that you may try your hand at Lisp; nothing promotes
learning like immediate feedback.</p>

<p>The chapters are quite short. It should be possible to read and
comprehend several in one sitting. This book was not meant to be
read in one sitting, so take your time. There are a few problems at
the ends of some of the chapters. Do them if you feel like it. Some
of them aren't meant for solution as much as for thought, so if you
think about them rather than actually doing them, that's
sufficient.</p>

<h4>TYPOGRAPHIC CONVENTIONS</h4>

Sometimes (especially in longer examples) in this book you will
find that lower case is used to indicate that a line of text is
being typed by the user; similarly, upper case denotes lines typed
by the Lisp system. If this convention is in use, there is one
minor exception to its rule. That is, the letter "L" will always
appear in upper case because its lower case form is the same as a
one and this might be very confusing in a program example.
Unfortunately, L is very often used in Lisp programs to mean
"List". 
<p>Parenthetical remarks are going to be enclosed in square
brackets ["[]"] instead of the normal parentheses because Lisp
makes a lot of use of parentheses and things will get confused.</p>

<h4>THE BOOK DISK</h4>

This texti is available with a floppy disk that contains all the
functions that we use in this book. Its purpose is to save you
typing time and to give you a pre-created environment to write your
programs in. If you already know what a Lisp environment is, fine.
If not, don't worry about it. It's covered later in the book. 
<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

The format of the book is as follow: We start with a chapter of
simple examples to get you comfortable with using the Lisp system.
We then move into several chapters which introduce the basic data
structure and functions. After that, we tell you how to define and
edit your own functions. We then introduce the concept of
recursion, fundamental to Lisp programming, and spend several
chapters exploring different uses of recursion. We lay out a few
examples of complicated Lisp programs in detail. The last section
of the book consists of some chapters on advanced Lisp techniques,
and the guts of the Lisp system itself. 
<p>Enjoy, and please feel free to let us know about any problems
you have or other things you would like to see.</p>
