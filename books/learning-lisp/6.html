<h2>Defining Your Own Functions</h2>

Up to this point in the discussion, Lisp has had a monopoly on
functions; we have been forced to use the ones supplied by the
system. If we were limited to these, Lisp wouldn't be much fun.
What we are leading up to is that you, the user, are able to
define, use, and even modify your own functions. 
<p>Suppose that you are one of those select people who do not like
the name CAR. Well, we are going to define a function called FIRST
which does exactly the same thing as CAR. Let's go into Lisp.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (FIRST (LAMBDA (L)

:        (CAR L)))))

  FIRST

:(FIRST '(THIS HAD BETTER WORK))

  THIS

:(FIRST '(LONG LIVE DEFINE))

  LONG
</pre>

<a name="define"></a> The explanation: We used the function DEFINE
to set up our FIRST function. DEFINE takes as its argument a list
containing the function definition. Note that we took more than one
line to enter the function definition. This will generally be the
case. Lisp will wait to see a matched set of parentheses. If you
are not careful with the parentheses, you may have to do a lot of
retyping. We can't explain everything about the form of the
function definition at this point in the book. Suffice it to say
that you must enter your functions in the above form. The first
element in the function definition list is the name of the function
you are defining, in this case, FIRST. The names that may be used
for a function are the same as those for an alphabetic atom name. 
<a name="lambda"></a>
<p>The next thing in the function definition is a list whose first
element is LAMBDA. Let's skip over the LAMBDA for the moment. <a
name="args"></a> Following the LAMBDA is a list of <em>formal
arguments</em> for your function. In our example, this is the list:
"(L)". We have to make explicit to Lisp the number of arguments our
function will have. We have already seen Lisp functions which take
one, two, or sometimes an indefinite number of arguments. If our
list had been (L1 L2) then we would be defining a function with a
function to behave like CAR, which has only one argument. After the
list of arguments comes an expression whose value will be returned
as the value of the function. In this case we want a CAR to be the
result. Note that we use the formal arguments in this expression.
This will be explained in more detail later.</p>

<p>The value of the Lisp function DEFINE is the name of the
function being defined.</p>

<p>Note that we called the list a list of formal arguments. What
are formal arguments? Well, we would like to be able to enter an
expression like the following:</p>

<p>(first x)</p>

<p>X is some pre-defined list. The name we use in the argument list
in the function definition will, when the above expression is
evaluated, take on the value of the list X. The name we use in our
function, however, <em>only serves as a place holder for the value
of the actual argument</em>. Note that here the actual argument is
X. The formal argument, which in the FIRST definition is L, takes
on the value of the actual argument when FIRST is evaluated. Be
careful here, because the value of L will revert to whatever value
[or lack thereof] it had previously, after the function had been
evaluated.</p>

<pre>
:

:(FIRST '(A LUCKY STAR))

  A

:L

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: L

+()

  NIL
</pre>

We know that L had a value inside the function, because the
function executed correctly. Once the function finishes, L goes
away. Poof! 
<p>Let's try our hand at another function definition.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (SECOND (LAMBDA (ALIST)

:     (CAR (CDR ALIST))))))

  SECOND

:(SECOND '(CAN YOU SAY THE WORD FUN))

  YOU

:ALIST

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: ALIST

+()

  NIL
</pre>

This dialogue shows the same characteristic behavior of formal
arguments: they clean up after themselves. That is, once the
function has been terminated, the values of the formal arguments
are no longer available. 
<p>Now, let's deal with functions with two arguments. Let's define
our own EQUAL function.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (SAME (LAMBDA (LIST1 LIST2)

:      (EQUAL LIST1 LIST2)))))))

  SAME

:(SAME '(TESTING) 'TESTING)

  NIL

:(SAME '(EQUAL) LIST2)

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: LIST2

+()

  NIL

:(SETQ LIST2 '(INVISIBLE))

  (INVISIBLE )

:(SAME 'CLONE 'CLONE)

  T

:LIST2

  (INVISIBLE )
</pre>

Note that not only can't we get to the formal arguments after the
function is finished, but if we have another object with the same
name as a formal argument then that variable keeps its value even
though the formal argument had a different value! That is both very
important and very confusing. You may want to re-read this
explanation and then try some of your own examples so that you
develop a "feel" for the operation of the formal arguments. 
<p>Suppose we want a function that will return the last element of
a list, sort of the opposite of CAR. Well, first we will need a
Lisp function called REVERSE.</p>

<p>REVERSE will return a list with all of its top-level elements
reversed. Let's make sure REVERSE works.</p>

<pre>
:(REVERSE '(P L E H))

  (H E L P )

:(REVERSE '(S D R A W K C A B))

  (B A C K W A R D S )

:(REVERSE '((A B) C D (E F))))

  ((E F ) D C (A B ) )
</pre>

Now we get to our function: LAST. How do we go about getting the
last element of a list? Well, now that we know about REVERSE, we
can reverse the list, and then take the CAR. Let's try it. 
<a name="nil"></a>
<pre>
:(DEFINE (LAST (LAMBDA (ZZZ)

:   (CAR (REVERSE ZZZ)))))

  LAST

:(LAST '(NOW IS THE TIME))

  TIME
</pre>

By this time you might be able to say to yourself, "So what?" Why
bother defining a trivial function like LAST when you could just
type out "(car (reverse . . .))"? The answer to this is two-fold.
First, the functions that you define won't be so trivial later on.
The work done in a single function is almost unlimited. We are just
using simple examples at this point. 
<a name="notnull"></a>
<p>The second reason for learning how to define simplistic
functions is more subtle. Remember that we mentioned the NOT
function in chapter 5? It did exactly the same things as NULL. In
fact we might have defined NOT [if it were not already there] by
typing:</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (NOT (LAMBDA (A)

:      (NULL A)))))

  NOT
</pre>

The reason for having both NULL and NOT is that in some cases it
makes more sense to the programmer to envision a NOT than a NULL.
Go back over the example in <a href="5.html">Chapter 5</a> and
you'll see this vividly. 
<p>As with NOT and NULL, suppose that we were using a list to hold
the names of our friends in the form:</p>

<p>(firstname middlename lastname)</p>

<p>We could then define functions called FIRSTNAME, MIDDLENAME, and
LASTNAME to access the parts of the list. They would represent CAR,
CADR, and CADDR respectively. It makes more sense to ask for
"(middlename friend)" than it does to ask for "(cadr friend)".</p>

<p>Using simple defined functions in this way helps us to organize
our own thoughts when designing a program and also helps others
when they try to read out work. Applying meaningful names to simple
things is one very important use of DEFINE.</p>

<h3>Exercises: Rolling Your Own Functions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Remember the infamous phone list? Define FIRST, SECOND, and
THIRD which will get the first, etc. entry from the phone list.
Note that these are no longer valid phone lists themselves.</li>

<li>Now define two functions: NAME and NUMBER which give you the
name or number from one of the result lists of the functions from
the previous problem.<br>
You should be able to do: 
<p>(NAME (FIRST PHONELIST))<br>
(NUMBER (FIRST PHONELIST)) etc.</p>
</li>

<li>Redo problems 1 and 2 from <a href="3.html">Chapter 3</a>,
using the functions you've just defined.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<pre>
(DEFINE (FIRST (LAMBDA (L)
        (CAR L))))

(DEFINE (SECOND (LAMBDA (L)
        (CADR L))))

(DEFINE (THIRD (LAMBDA (L)
        (CADDR L))))
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<pre>
(DEFINE (NAME (LAMBDA (L)
        (CAR L))))

(DEFINE (NUMBER (LAMBDA (L)
        (CADR L))))
</pre>
</li>

<li>An expression to reverse the list is: 
<pre>
(CONS (THIRD L) (CONS (SECOND L) (CONS (FIRST L) '() )))
</pre>

An expression to reverse the list and each entry is: 
<pre>
(CONS
  (CONS (NUMBER (THIRD L)) (CONS (NAME (THIRD L)) '()))
  (CONS
   (CONS (NUMBER (SECOND L)) (CONS (NAME (SECOND L)) '()))
   (CONS
    (CONS (NUMBER (FIRST L)) (CONS (NAME (FIRST L)) '()))
   '()))
    )
)
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
