<h2>Efficiency and Elimination of Recursion</h2>

We have disregarded one issue throughout this entire book, namely,
how hard the computer has to work to evaluate a function. In this
chapter, we are going to look at some different ways of writing the
same function, with emphasis on the efficiency of the evaluation.
<a name="fact"></a> 
<p>Here are four different versions of the factorial function.</p>

<pre>
:(define (fact1 (lambda (n)
:  (cond
:    ((equal n 0) 1)
:    (t (mult n (fact1 (sub n 1))))
:  )
:)))

FACT1

:(define (fact2 (lambda (n)
:  (cond
:    ((equal n 0) 1)
:    ((equal n 1) 1)
:    (t (mult n (fact2 (sub n 1))))
:  )
:)))

FACT2

:(define (fact3 (lambda (n)
:  (prog (m prod)
:    (setq m 0)
:    (setq prod 1)
:    loop
:    (cond
:       ((equal m n) (return prod))
:    )
:    (setq m (add m 1))
:    (setq prod (mult prod m))
:    (go loop)
:  )
:)))

FACT3

:(define (fact4 (lambda (n)
:  (fact4a n 1)
:)))

FACT4

:(define (fact4a (lambda (n m)
:  (cond
:    ((equal n 0) m)
:    (t (fact4a (sub n 1)
:  )
:)))

FACT4A
</pre>

We haven't shown them working, but take our word for it, they do.
What are the salient differences between each of the functions? 
<p>FACT1 and FACT2 are the standard recursive definitions of the
factorial. However, since FACT2 tests for an argument of 1, it will
end a chain of recursive calls one setp sooner than FACT1. We still
need to test for 0 because 0 is a special case. The importance of
one less recursive call is, in this application, negligible.</p>

<a name="loop"></a> 
<p>FACT3 shows the factorial function in its iterative form. There
is only one function call, but the function will loop n times just
as FACT1 will call itself n times. Depending upon the phase of the
moon, the iterative solution might be more efficient for the
computer [that is, it will execute faster]. The recursive form will
usually be more legible, though.</p>

<a name="coll"></a> 
<p>The fourth definition uses what is known as a <em>collection
variable</em>, or an accumulation variable. As we decrement n we
keep the running product in the collection variable m. The FACT4
function serves only to pass the value of n and set up the
collection variable for the function FACT4A. Although it may not
seem very useful, this technique can be used to define very
efficient recursive functions. It is particularly useful in cases
where some values of the function are recomputed by different
recursive calls.</p>

<a name="compilerinterpreter"></a> 
<p>So much for factorial. We mentioned several times that Lisp was
an <em>interpreter</em>. What does this mean? Language processors
come in two different types, interpreters, and <em>compilers</em>.
An interpreter is a computer program written in assembly language
[the language that is very close to what the computer understands
directly]. <a name="rep"></a>An interpreter works in what is called
a READ-EVAL-PRINT loop. If we were to call a function 1000 times,
Lisp would re-evaluate each part of the function 1000 times. This
is waste of time. This is where a compiler comes in. A Lisp
compiler would translate each function into machine language. [This
is what the computer processor understands directly.] This would
make each function execute much more rapidly. You tipically would
not want to use a compiler to compile functions while you are
developing the programs. Because compiling takes a finite amount of
time, you normally would want to wait until all your functions are
debugged before running them through a compiler.</p>
