attempt to follow gholoum incremental compiler paper.

procedure calls appear to work.

si means stack index - the first FREE SLOT to save into using MOV

rule 1 :  PRESERVE stack index 

that means nothing like these commands in the generated code
  PUSH DWORD EAX      -- alters ESP ruins indexing
  POP DWORD EBX  -- alters ESP ruins indexing 
  ADD DWORD ESP , 4 -- alters ESP ruins indexing
  SUB DWORD ESP , 4 -- alters ESP ruins indexing

must not alter the ESP register directly or indirectly unless DOING the procedure call
in which case

rule 2 :  PRESERVE esi HEAP alignment to multiple of 8 

  ADD ESI , 8   -- clean simple and safe bump
