<h2>Properties and Lambda Expressions</h2>

We have seen several ways to attach "meanings" to names [atoms].
The SETQ function gives a value to an atom. There is one other way
of connecting values to atoms. 
<a name="prop"></a>
<p>A <em>property</em> is a name associated with a particular value
of an atom. As an analogy, think of an atom as a chest of drawers.
The top drawer would contain something, the second would contain
something different, and so on. Each thing in the drawers, however,
is still associated with the chest [the atom].</p>

<p>Let's construct our chest of drawers.</p>

<pre>
:(PUT 'CHEST 'TOP '(SOX))

  (SOX )

:(PUT 'CHEST 'SECOND '(UNDERWEAR (SHORT

:SHIRTS))))

  (UNDERWEAR (SHORT SHIRTS ) )

:(PUT 'CHEST 'THIRD '(T-SHIRTS JEANS)))

  (T-SHIRTS JEANS )

:(PUT 'CHEST 'BOTTOM '(PAJAMAS)))

  (PAJAMAS )
</pre>

<a name="atomvalget"></a> The PUT function takes three arguments. The
first is the name of the atom that we are attaching properties to
["chest"]. The next is the name of the property ["top", "bottom",
etc.], and the third is the value to attach to the atom at that
property. This value can be anything at all [lists, names,
numbers]. The GET function looks at properties on an atom. 
<pre>
:(GET 'CHEST 'SECOND)

  (UNDERWEAR (SHORT SHIRTS ) )

:(GET 'CHEST 'TOP)

  (SOX )

:(SETQ PLACE 'CHEST)

  CHEST

:(PUT PLACE 'TOP (CONS (GET PLACE 'TOP)

:(GET PLACE 'SECOND)))))

  ((SOX ) UNDERWEAR (SHORT SHIRTS ) )

:(REM PLACE 'SECOND)

  NIL

:(GET PLACE 'SECOND)

  NIL
</pre>
<a name="rem"></a>
In case you hadn't figured it out, REM removes a property from the
property list. It's similar to pulling out a drawer. We can't GET
the value of that property after it has been REMed. 
<p>We said previously that you couldn't take the CDR of an atom.
That isn't quite true. The CDR of a name [a quoted atom] returns
all the properties associated with that atom in the form:</p>

<pre>
:(CDR PLACE)

  (TOP ((SOX ) UNDERWEAR (SHORT SHIRTS ) )
  THIRD (T-SHIRTS JEANS ) BOTTOM (
  PAJAMAS ) )

:(CDR 'CHEST)

  (TOP ((SOX ) UNDERWEAR (SHORT SHIRTS ) )
  THIRD (T-SHIRTS JEANS ) BOTTOM (
  PAJAMAS ) )
</pre>

The value set by SETQ and the properties associated with the name
are completely separate. 
<pre>
:
:(SETQ CHEST 5)

  5

:(CDR 'CHEST)

  (TOP ((SOX ) UNDERWEAR (SHORT SHIRTS ) )
  THIRD (T-SHIRTS JEANS ) BOTTOM (
  PAJAMAS ) )

:CHEST

  5
</pre>
<a name="phone"></a>
What are properties used for? Why are they in Lisp? 
<p>For a simple example we might arrange our phonebook according to
our friends' names. Each name has associated with it a property
"number" and a property "address". This isn't much different than
just having the names, numbers, and addresses arranged as a list of
triplets. The advantage of using the properties is that the process
of finding someone's phone number or address is simply a matter of
getting the right property from the atom which is the person's
name.</p>

<pre>
:

:(PUT 'MARY 'ADDRESS '(123 FRONT ROAD))

  (123 FRONT ROAD )

:(PUT 'MARY 'PHONE '(345 6789))

  (345 6789 )

:(CDR 'MARY)

  (ADDRESS (123 FRONT ROADD ) PHONE (
  345 6789 ) )

:(PUT 'DAVE 'ADDRESS '(321 TRONF STREET))

  (321 TRONF STREET )

:(PUT 'DAVE 'PHONE '(WE7 1212))

  (WE7 1212 )

:(GET 'DAVE 'ADDRESS)

  (321 TRONF STREET )
</pre>

But this is useless because we are restricted to using address
parts and phone numbers that are Lisp atoms. Anyway we could have
done the whole program with recursion and gotten the same result.
However, as an exercise it can't hurt. 
<p>Another possible use of properties is to "tag" names. For
example, let's imagine that we were going to type in a dictionary
and wanted to tag each word that we typed with its part of speech.
We also might want to include some other identifications like
number [for nouns] or transitivity [for verbs]. By using PUT and
GET to attach properties to the atom whose name is the word, we can
accomplish this tagging quite simply.</p>

<pre>
:(PUT 'AARDVARK 'SPEECHPART 'NOUN)

  NOUN

:(PUT 'AARDVARK 'NUMBER 'SINGULAR)

  SINGULAR

:(PUT 'EAT 'SPEECHPART 'VERB)

  VERB

:(PUT 'EAT 'VERBTYPE 'TRANSITIVE)

  TRANSITIVE

:(PUT 'SOUPS 'SPEECHPART 'NOUN)

  NOUN

:(PUT 'SOUPS 'NUMBER 'PLURAL)

  PLURAL
</pre>
<a name="mapcar"></a>
If we want to retrieve all parts of speech from a list of words, we
could use MAPCAR with a function which will return the speechpart
property from a word. Here is the function PARTS which does just
that. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (PARTS (FLAMBDA (SENTENCE)

:  (MAPCAR '(LAMBDA (WORD) (GET WORD 'SPEECHPART))

:          SENTENCE)))))

  PARTS

:(PARTS EAT AARDVARK SOUPS)

  (VERB NOUN NOUN)
</pre>

What, you may ask, was all that about? It looks like we half-wrote
a function in the middle of another one! The expression "(LAMBDA
(WORD) . . . 'SPEECHPART))" is typical of what we type for the
definition of a function using DEFINE. 
<p>Let's look at some simpler examples:</p>

<pre>
:(SETQ FN '(LAMBDA (X) (REVERSE X))))

  (LAMBDA (X ) (REVERSE X ) )

:(FN '(THE VALUE OF FN IS A LAMBDA))

  (LAMBDA A IS FN OF VALUE THE )

:('(LAMBDA (X) (REVERSE X)) '(THIS ONE

:IS RIGHT HERE)))

  (HERE RIGHT IS ONE THIS )
</pre>

LAMBDA expressions, variables whose values are LAMBDA expressions,
or expressions which evaluate to LAMBDA expressions, can be used in
a Lisp expression in any place a function name would normally
occur. A LAMBDA expression is like a temporary function. The
appropriate values of its arguments are bound during evaluation,
but after the result is returned, the function, and the argument
values, go away. <a name="define"></a> 
<p>When we use DEFINE to establish a function definition, it puts
the LAMBDA expression forming the body of the function as a
property of the function name. The property where this function is
stored is called EXPR.</p>

<pre>
:(CDR 'PARTS)

  (EXPR (FLAMBDA (SENTENCE ) (MAPCAR (
  QUOTE (LAMBDA (WORD ) (GET WORD (QUOTE S
  PEECHPART ) ) ) ) SENTENCE ) ) )

:(GET 'PARTS 'EXPR)

  (FLAMBDA (SENTENCE ) (MAPCAR (QUOTE (
  LAMBDA (WORD ) (GET WORD (QUOTE
  SPEECHPART ) ) ) ) SENTENCE ) )
</pre>

In general, LISP looks at the world as follows: 
<ol>
<li>Everything is an expression [that is, has a CAR and a CDR or is
an atom].</li>

<li>If the expression is an atom then return its value.</li>

<li>If the expression is a list then apply rule 4 to the CAR and
use the CDR as the arguments to the function referred to in rule
4.</li>

<li>If the CAR is an atom then either its value is a LAMBDA
expression [as example 3 above] or it has an EXPR on its property
list whose value [i.e., (GET (CAR expression) 'EXPR)] is a LAMBDA
expression [as in all the functions created by DEFINE]. Evaluate
the LAMBDA expression!</li>

<li>If the CAR is a list, evaluate it and go to rule 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all a bit complicated. Perhaps a few examples would help
out. First, let's suppose that the variable [atom] X has the value
"(lambda (f) (reverse f))".</p>

<p>We enter:</p>

<pre>
((CAR '(X Y Z)) '(LIST TO BE REVERSED))
</pre>

X [the result of CAR . . .] evals to the form: 
<pre>
((LAMBDA (F) (REVERSE '(F)) '(LIST TO BE REVERSED))
</pre>

The F binds to the argument. The new expression is: 
<pre>
(REVERSE '(LIST TO BE REVERSED))
</pre>

which returns: 
<pre>
(REVERSED BE TO LIST)
</pre>
<a name="lambda"></a>
<p>We could have equivalently used DEFINE to jam the LAMBDA
expression into the EXPR property of the atom X. The evaluation
would have worked in the same way. In a previous chapter we asked
whether DEFINE was an EXPR or a FEXPR. Since we know what DEFINE
really does, we can define it. This seems a bit redundant, and it
is, but it is a good exercise.</p>

<p>DEFINE is of the form:</p>

<pre>
(DEFINE (name (LAMBDA-expression)))
</pre>

<p>Since (name (LAMBDA-expression)) can't be evaluated [especially
before the name is defined] we have to use a FEXPR in order to keep
Lisp from trying to evaluate it. Our first line must be:</p>

<pre>
(DEFINE (DEFINE (FLAMBDA (function-form)
</pre>

The function-form will have the form: 
<pre>
(name (LAMBDA-expression))
</pre>

<p>Now, our task is easy. Let's redefine DEFINE in real Lisp and
see if it works as expected. If you try to do this, it is a good
idea to call it something other than DEFINE [like DEFINA], to avoid
making catastrophic mistakes.</p>

<pre>
:
:(DEFINE (DEFINA (FLAMBDA (FUNCFORM)

: (PUT (CAAR FUNCFORM) 'EXPR (CADAR

:    FUNCFORM)))))

  DEFINE

:(DEFINA (ENDOF (LAMBDA (S)

:        (CAR (REVERSE S))))))))

  (LAMBDA (S ) (CAR (REVERSE S ) ) )

:(CDR 'ENDOF)

  (EXPR (LAMBDA (S ) (CAR (REVERSE S ) ) )
  )

:(ENDOF '(A S D F))

  F

:(CDR 'DEFINA)

  (EXPR (FLAMBDA (FUNCFORM ) (PUT (CAAR
  FUNCFORM ) (QUOTE EXPR ) (CADAR FUNCFORM
  ) ) ) )

:(REM 'DEFINA 'EXPR)

  NIL

:(CDR 'DEFINA)

  NIL

:(CDR 'DEFINE)

  (SUBR * )
</pre>
<a name="subr"></a>
Note that when we redefined DEFINE we are using only the value of
DEFINA. The property that you see in the last line above [SUBR]
holds the real value of DEFINE. When we REM our EXPR definition
from DEFINE's property list the old value [SUBR] comes back [IF YOU
USE DEFINE INSTEAD OF DEFINA, DON'T FORGET TO DO THIS]! Don't worry
about what a SUBR really is, we will discuss that on the chapter
about internals. 
<p>Lisp functions exist as properties of atoms with the name of the
atom being the name of the function. Since Lisp functions are only
Lisp expressions, you can see how being able to manipulate these
expressions can be useful. For one thing, it means we can write our
own editor in Lisp. It means that we can write functions which
generate other functions during their evaluation.</p>
