<h2>Scope Considerations</h2>
<a name="valuestack"></a>
<a name="env"></a> Lisp functions live, work, and play in an
environment. We learned how to save that contents of the
environment a while back. The purpose of this chapter is to
describe this environment and the effects of lambda-binding on it.
<a name="builtin"></a> 
<p>When you enter the Lisp system, there are some predefined Lisp
functions [the built-ins] and two predefined variables, T and NIL.
Using SETQ to define your own variables causes Lisp to set up an
area of storage for holding the value of that variable. Thus,
evaluating the expression, (SETQ A 10), Lisp binds the value of 10
to the variable A, setting up something like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imgs/cell1.png" width="64" height="57"
alt="A Cell"></p>

<a name="glob"></a> Since we are not currently evaluating any
function, this value of A is said to be in the global environment.
The global environment is the state of affairs at the highest level
[that is, not inside any functions]. Any subsequent use of the SETQ
function with A will change the value in A. 
<p>The interaction of the assignment with the evaluation of
user-defined functions is interesting. Remember that the global
value of variables are left untouched even though the local
variables in the function may have the same name. Let's define some
functions with which we can experiment.</p>

<pre>
:(SETQ X 10)

  10

:(SETQ Y 20)

  20

:(DEFINE (FUN1 (LAMBDA (X)

:    (PRINT X)

:    (PRINT Y)

:    (FUN2 X Y)

:    (FUN3 (ADD X 1)))))

  FUN1

:(DEFINE (FUN2 (LAMBDA (X Z)

:    (PRINT X)

:    (PRINT Y)

:    (PRINT Z)

:    (SETQ Y 5))))

  FUN2

:(DEFINE (FUN3 (LAMBDA (R)

:    (PRINT R)

:    (PRINT X)

:    (PRINT Z))))

  FUN3

:(FUN1 2)
  2
  20
  2
  20
  3
  2
  5

:X

  10

:Y

  5

<a name="valuestack2"></a>
We defined three somewhat contrived functions. We begin the process
of evaluation by typing "(fun1 2)". When FUN1 is evaluated, the
value of its actual argument 2 is bound to the local variable X.
But X already exists in the global environment by means of the SETQ
function. Lisp always checks to see if a conflict between a global
variable and a local variable esists. If there is such a conflict,
the new value is stacked on top of the older value or values. This
can be better understood with the help of the following picture: 
<p align="center"><img src="imgs/cell2.png" width="212" height="94"
alt="Variable value stacking"></p>
<a name="local"></a>
The value of the atom in evaluation is designated by the value at
the top of its stack. Therefore, the value of X at this point is 2
and the value of Y is 20. These values are called a local
environment. 
<p>After the function, in which the local variable is defined,
ends, the topmost [current] value is removed from the stack. Thus,
the older value is returned. Note that the global environment can't
be removed from the stack in this way.</p>

<p>While inside the function, the local value acts like a global
value to all the functions called by the first function. The same
is true for all deeper levels of function calls.</p>

<p>Back to our example. We are now inside the function FUN1. The
first expression to be evaluated is "(PRINT X)". This causes the
current value of X to be printed. Since X is a local variable to
this function, the current value of X is the value of the argument
supplied in the call of the function FUN1. This is the number 2
which we typed ourselves. Therefore, it is the first 2 in the
output. The next expression, "(PRINT Y)", prints the global value
of Y, which is 20.</p>

<p>The next expression, "(FUN2 X Y)" is a call to the function
FUN2. The formal arguments for FUN2 are X and Z. Because X already
exists in the environment [twice, in fact], we must again "stack"
the new value, 2, on top of the older value, 2. [Note that the old
value and the new value are the same. Lisp does not care, it will
save the old one anyway.] Also, the value of 20 is bound to Z. The
new environment looks like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imgs/cell3.png" width="315" height=
"112" alt="The environment after calling FUN2"></p>
<a name="side"></a>
We are now inside of FUN2 [which is inside of FUN1]. The value of X
is printed as 2, in the third output line. Then, the value of Y is
printed. This is 20. Next, the value of Z in printed [20, the fifth
line]. We then use the SETQ function to assign a value to the
variable Y. Therefore, Y now has the value of 5. If Y had been a
local variable in FUN2, then the assignment would have been broken
when leaving FUN2. However, since Y is global, this assignment of
value is permanent, at least until the next assignment. The action
of changing the value of a variable which is not one of the
function's formal arguments is called a side effect. Side effects
are usually very nasty, and should be avoided. 
<p>FUN2 now exits, returning the value of Y [which is thrown away].
We are now back in FUN1 and the uppermost level has been removed
from the stack.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="imgs/cell4.png" width="255" height="83"
alt="The environment after FUN2 is finished"></p>

Next, we call FUN3 with the expression "(FUN3 (ADD X 1))". The
value of X inside FUN1 is 2. Therefore, (ADD X 1) evaluates to 3.
The value of the formal argument in FUN3, namely R, has the value
of 3 bound to it. 
<p align="center"><img src="imgs/cell5.png" width="315" height=
"112" alt="The environment after calling FUN3"></p>

The value of R is now printed on the sixth line. The variables X
and Y are also printed. The question is, which X and which Y?
Neither are local to FUN3. For X, we use the value which was
available in the previous environment, that is FUN1. There, X had
the value 2. Therefore, a 2 is printed for X. What about Y? Y isn't
local to any function, so Lisp uses the global value of 5. [Note
that the global value was assigned from inside the function FUN2.] 
<p>The last number printed is the value returned from FUN1. FUN1 is
returned from FUN3, which is returned from PRINT. Remember that
everything in Lisp returns a value, even PRINT.</p>
