<h2>Eval and Apply</h2>

In this brief chapter, we will show you the entire Lisp
interpreter. Well, not really, but we will show you some functions
which form the "heart" of the Lisp system. <a name="eval"></a> 
<p>When you type an expression into the Lisp system, it is passed
to a function called EVAL. EVAL [EVALuate] processes your
expression and returns the result. What is this thing called
EVAL?</p>

<pre>
:(SETQ A '(CAR B))

  (CAR B )

:(SETQ B '(AA BB CC DD))

  (AA BB CC DD )

:(EVAL A)

  AA

:(CAR '(AA BB CC DD))

  AA

:(EVAL 'A)

  (CAR B )
</pre>

Let's see what happened. First we defined two variables, A and B.
Note that the value of A is a legal Lisp expression. When Lisp
EVALuates A, it is as if we had typed in the expression ourselves.
Lisp returns the value of the expression as the result. When Lisp
EVALuates "A", it returns the value of the value of 'A, which is
the same thing as the value of A. 
<p>The importance of this ability may not be immediately apparent.
However, notice that this enables us to manipulate programs as data
and then evaluate them. Most other programming languages do not
provide this facility. Here is a small example.</p>

<pre>
:(SETQ FUN 'MULT)

  MULT

:(SETQ X 3)

  3

:(SETQ Y 2)

  2

:(SETQ VARS '(X Y))

  (X Y )

:(EVAL (CONS FUN VARS))

  6
</pre>

<a name="apply"></a> In Lisp, there is another function which will
evaluate a function and its data: APPLY. The generic form of the
APPLY function is "(APPLY function-name list-of-arguments)". To
repeat the last line in the above example use the APPLY function. 
<pre>
:(APPLY FUN X Y)

  6
</pre>
<a name="poly"></a>
Let's apply what we know about EVAL to the problem of evaluating
polynomials. The polynomials are going to be represented by their
associated Lisp expressions. Thus, 
<pre>
3x<sup>2</sup>+15
</pre>

will be represented as 
<pre>
(ADD (MULT 3 (MULT x x)) 15)
</pre>

Suppose we have this representation as the value of some variable. 
<pre>
:(SETQ P '(ADD (MULT 3 (MULT X X)) 15))))

  (ADD (MULT 3 (MULT X X ) ) 15 )

:(EVAL P)

  42
</pre>

<a name="fexpr"></a> Now we have the capability to form polynomials
and then evaluate them. EVAL gives us a very handy way of making
FEXPRs much more powerful. Suppose that we wanted to write an
addition function that used many arguments, no just two. We want to
be able to write "(add* 1 2 3 . . .)" and get back their sums.
Here's a possible FEXPR to do that. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (ADD* (FLAMBDA (L)

:  (ADD-SUB L))))

   ADD*

:(DEFINE (ADD-SUB (LAMBDA (L)

:  (COND

:    ((NULL L) 0)

:    (T (ADD (CAR L) (ADD-SUB (CDR L))))))))

   ADD-SUB
</pre>

Convince yourself that this works for "(add* 1 2 3 4 5)". Now try
using SETQ to set up some values and use them in ADD*. 
<pre>
:(SETQ SOME 5)

  5

:(SETQ MORE 6)

  6

:(SETQ VALUES 7)

  7

:(ADD* VALUES MORE SOME)

    ** ERROR: BAD NUMERIC ARG **
      ADD :: ((CAR L ) (ADD-SUB (CDR L ) )
      )

+()

  NIL
</pre>

What happened? Well, when recursion stopped down in ADD-SUB, it
returned a 0 which the next level tried to add to the then-car of
the list, SOME. Well, SOME is not a number! ADD can't deal with it
like that! SOME is not an atom--it has a value, but its name isn't
that value [it isn't like numeric atoms in that respect]. How do we
get its value from its name? Right, EVAL! Here's a new definition
of ADD-SUB that works: 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (ADD-SUB (LAMBDA (L)

:  (COND ((NULL L) 0)

:  (T (ADD (EVAL (CAR L))

:     (ADD-SUB (CDR L))))))))

  ADD-SUB
</pre>

Convince yourself! Trace EVAL and ADD-SUB and see why. 
<h3>Exercises to Evaluate in Your Head</h3>

<ol>
<li>There is a way to write ADD* by changing ADD* itself instead of
ADD-SUB. It also relies on EVAL but it does the evaluation before
ADD-SUB ever gets called. Can you think of a way of doing this? If
so, fix ADD*. If not, look up MAPCAR and recurse through this
problem!</li>

<li>Write a function called DEFUN that permits us to get rid of
some of the irritating parentheses. We want to be able to do this: 
<pre>
:(defun function-name (args list) body . . .)
:(defun function-name fexpr (arg) body . . .)
</pre>

Have it fill the material that DEFINE wants to see and then call
DEFINE. Notice that unless we say "fexpr", it makes an EXPR. This
will need a special test.</li>

<li>Write a function called NEWSETQ that counts the number of times
it is used. It should look exactly like SETQ as far as its
arguments are concerned. You should also keep the count in some
global variable called NEWSETQ-USE-COUNT.</li>
</ol>
