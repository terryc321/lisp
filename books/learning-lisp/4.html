<h2>Atoms and Values</h2>

<a name="atom"></a> In the previous chapters we discussed lists of
objects. These objects could have been either atoms or lists. The
exact meaning of atom was sidestepped. Here we will look a little
deeper into what an atom is and how they hold information. 
<p>Let's go back and repeat the definition of an atom given in <a
href="2.html">chapter 2</a>: An atom is a word or a number or the
pair of parentheses "()" which we will call "NIL". So, by that
description, all of the following are atoms:</p>

<pre>
hello
31415
()
car
axe
0
stephen
anatom
12345
</pre>

<p>In fact, there are a few more things that we can use as atoms
also. The rules for creating atoms are, to be exact, as
follows.</p>

<a name="alphafloat"></a> 
<ul>
<li>An atom can be any number the computer understands. This is
called a numeric atom. These are <em>integers</em> like: 145, -15,
0, etc., or <em>floating point numbers</em> [ones with fractional
parts] like: 1.4, -56.3, etc.</li>

<li>A non-numeric atom can be any name made up of letters and/or
numbers. There is no limit on the length of this. The only
restriction is that the first character must be a letter, not a
number. This is called an alphanumeric atom.</li>

<li><a name="nil"></a>The form of NIL "()" can be an atom.</li>

<li>Alphanumeric atoms can have some funny characters in them [such
as "*" and "+"] but special Lisp characters cannot be used in atom
names. This should be clear by now. The characters "(", ")", and
"'", would simply confuse Lisp if you tried to use them in atom
names. In general, we avoid using anything other than the letters
"A" through "Z" and the numbers "0" through "9" in atom names.</li>
</ul>

Using the above rules, these are not atoms: 
<pre>
456test
a sentence like this is not an atom
some'stuff
this(isn't(one(either
(1 2 3 4)   [this one's a list, remember?]
</pre>

<a name="atomval"></a> 
<p>As we usually do, we'll see what happens when atoms are given to
Lisp to evaluate.</p>
<a name="undef"></a>
<pre>
:ANATOM

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: ANATOM

+()

  NIL

:T

  T

:NIL

  NIL

:()

  NIL

:567

  567
</pre>

That seemed to work alright, except for the first one. What
happened? It looks like some atoms are defined according to Lisp
and some aren't. 
<a name="value"></a>
<p>Atoms have values. Some atoms have values that are automatically
set by Lisp when you start it. Others need to be given values by
you, the user, when you want to do something. When an atom is typed
into Lisp it is evaluated just like a list except that instead of
executing a function, the result of the evaluation is the value of
that atom.</p>
<a name="nil2"></a>
<p>We can see the types of atoms mentioned in the previous
paragraph used in the example above. The atoms "T" and "NIL" seem
to already have values in Lisp. The value of "T" is "T". The value
of "NIL" is "NIL" or "()" which, as we've said over and over, is
the same thing. The atom 567 also has a value. In fact, all numeric
atoms have values that are the numbers they represent. Numbers and
those special atoms are called <em>self-defining</em> atoms.</p>

<p>Okay, then how do we define those atoms that aren't
self-defining? There's a way to do that too! [There's a way to do
most everything in Lisp.]</p>

<a name="setq"></a>
<p>Watch this:</p>
<pre>
:LOVE

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: LOVE

+()

  NIL

:(SETQ LOVE 5)

  5

:LOVE

  5

:(SETQ HAPPINESS LOVE)

  5

:HAPPINESS

  5

:(SETQ POWER FREEDOM)

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: FREEDOM

+()

  NIL
</pre>

The first example just shows that, in fact, the value of love is
undefined. Let's define it. 
<p>The SETQ function takes the name of an atom and the value to
"assign" to that atom. It puts that value into the named atom and
then, voila, instant definition! Note that the value returned by
SETQ is the same as the value of the second argument. You will find
that all Lisp expressions return a value of some kind.</p>

<p>Note that, in the fourth example, the atom now properly defined
has a value that can be used to assign to other atoms. An error
will occur if you try to assign the value of an undefined atom in a
SETQ operation.</p>

<p>As with a list, if we want to tell Lisp not to try to evaluate
an atom, you can simply put a single quote before it:</p>

<pre>
:THE-VALUE

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: THE-VALUE

+()

  NIL

:(SETQ ATOM1 'THE-VALUE)

  THE-VALUE

:(CONS ATOM1 '(IS THE VALUE OF ATOM1))

  (THE-VALUE IS THE VALUE OF ATOM1 )

:(SETQ ATOM2 (CONS ATOM1 '(IS THE VALUE

: OF ATOM1))))

  (THE-VALUE IS THE VALUE OF ATOM1 )
</pre>

Above, we have used the value of ATOM1 and the CONS function to
create a list made up of the value of ATOM1 and some other atoms.
You should be very careful about the placement of quotes at all
times. A quote is used when you mean the <em>expression</em> itself
rather than the result of evaluation of the expression. 
<p>In the last example, the result of the CONS operation is SETQed
into a new atom: ATOM2.</p>

<p>You will find that one of the best uses of SETQ is to save you
from having to type the same list over and over again. We can use
atom values in our examples to save our typing also. This is one of
the examples from <a href="2.html">chapter 2</a> redone with value
atoms and SETQ's:</p>

<pre>
:(SETQ SANDWITCH '(SAND WITCH))

  (SAND WITCH)

:(CDR SANDWITCH)

  (WITCH )

:(CDR (CDR (CDR  SANDWITCH)))))

  NIL

:(CAR (CDR SANDWITCH))

  WITCH

:(CAR (CAR (CDR (SETQ CLOWNY ' (() ((BOZO

:) (NO NO))))))))
  (BOZO )

:(CDR (CAR (CDR CLOWNY)))

  ((NO NO ) )

:(CAR (CAR (CDR (CAR (CDR CLOWNY)))))))
</pre>

You should go back to the example in the previous chapter and
carefully study what was done in order to use value-atoms. Let's
not lose sight of the evaluation process in all thiss mumbo-jumbo.
Remember that the arguments of a function are evaluated first and
the results are replaced for that position in the expression. Using
this rule, let's go through the evaluation of the last expression
above. 
<p>We start out with:</p>

<pre>
:(CAR (CAR (CDR (CAR (CDR CLOWNY)))))

  NO
</pre>

First, "clowny" is evaluated as a list that was SETQed to it
previously, giving us: 
<pre>
(car (car (cdr (car (cdr '<u>(()  ((bozo) (no no))))))))</u>
</pre>

[The underlined portion is the SETQed text]. The various CARs and
CDRs are evaluated giving: 
<pre>
(car (car (cdr (car  '<u>(((bozo) (no no))))))))</u>
(car (car (cdr  '<u>((bozo) (no no)))))</u>
(car (car  '<u>((no no))))</u>
(car  '<u>(no no))</u>
no
</pre>

This process is the most important thing that you need to know and
it is assumed in all our discussions. <a name="dquote"></a> 
<p>One last thing before we move on. It is often useful to be able
to put funny characters [like spaces and open or close parens] into
atom names. The most obvious use of this is to print things out.
Even though it's technically against the rules to use spaces, etc.,
in atom names, Lisp provides a way to do so. The quotation
character ["] can be used to enclose <em>atom</em> names. Don't
confuse this with the quote that stops evaluation. For example:</p>

<pre>
:(SETQ "A LONG ATOM NAME" 5)

  5

:"A LONG ATOM NAME"

  5

:(SETQ "ANOTHER NAME" '"A MESSAGE")

  A MESSAGE

:"ANOTHER NAME"

  A MESSAGE

:
</pre>

In the second example above, we quoted an enclosed atom in order to
put a message with spaces in as the value of the atom: A LONG ATOM
NAME<br>
Note that Lisp doesn't print out the quotation marks around
enclosed names. This is convenient because it permits us to use
them as messages. You'll see this used if you look over the code
for the Lisp editor that is included in an appendix. Don't look
now, though. You'll need to know more of the language first. 
<h3>Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li>Indicate what you think Lisp would respond with if you type in
the following: 
<ol type="a">
<li>:(setq apple 'fruit)</li>

<li>:(setq pear apple)</li>

<li>:(setq iq 140)</li>

<li>:(setq 15 12)</li>

<li>:'apple</li>

<li>:apple</li>

<li>:"apple"</li>

<li>:'"()"</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Remember all the recopying that we did in the most recent set
of exercises. Well, now you should be able to figure out how to set
the phone list as the value of some variable, and just use that
variable. Try it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>FRUIT</li>

<li>FRUIT</li>

<li>140</li>

<li>You should expect this to cause an error; since numeric atoms
are self-defining, you shouldn't be able to change their
values.</li>

<li>APPLE</li>

<li>FRUIT</li>

<li>FRUIT. Note that APPLE and "APPLE" denote the same atom, since
the atom names are the same (double quotes enclose atom names, but
are not part of the name).</li>

<li>(). This creates an atom whose name is the characters "(" and
")". It is NOT the same as the atom NIL.</li>
</ol>
