<h2>Lists, CAR and CDR</h2>

We are going to direct our attention towards the structure of data
in the Lisp language. All expressions in Lisp are in the form of a
<em>list</em>. Even functions that we will define in a later
chapter will be in the form of a list. Lists are so important that
the next several chapters will be devoted to developing your
facility in using lists. 
<p>And now, meet the list.</p>

<a name="atom"></a> 
<p>A list is a linear arrangement of objects separated by blanks
and surrounded by parentheses. The obkects which make up a list are
either <em>atoms</em> or other lists. An atom is the basic unit of
data understood by the Lisp language.</p>

<p>Here are some atoms.</p>

<pre>
carbon
eve
1
bananastand
</pre>

Here are some lists: 
<pre>
(1 2 3 4)
((i hate) (peanut butter) (and jelly))
(you (walrus (hurt) the (one you) love))
(add 3 (mult 4 5))
(garbage (garbage) out)
(car ((in the garage) park))
(deeper and (deeper and (deeper and (deeper we went))))
</pre>

Please note several things. 
<ul>
<li><a name="nil"></a>Some of the atoms in the above lists are:
"i", "()", "4", and "deeper". An atom is a word or number or the
pair of parentheses "()" which will be referred to as "NIL".</li>

<li><a name="paren"></a>The parentheses in a list will always be
<em>balanced</em> because every list is surrounded by a left and
right parenthesis, and the only things inside which have
parentheses are other lists.</li>

<li>The definition given above permits us to nest lists within
other lists to any arbitrary depth.</li>
</ul>

You should note that the parentheses are used to denote the list;
they are not actually part of the list. 
<p>"you" is an atom.<br>
"(walrus (hurt) the (one you) love)" is a list.<br>
</p>

<p>The parts of that list are</p>

<p>"walrus" is an atom.<br>
"(hurt)" is a list with one element: the atom "hurt".<br>
"the" is an atom.<br>
"(one you)" is a list with the elements: "one" and "you", each of
these is an atom.<br>
"love" is an atom.</p>

What does Lisp do with lists? Well, whenever you type a list into
Lisp it tries to evaluate that list. 
<p>Rules for lists being evaluated:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first element of the list should be a Lisp function [like
ADD].</li>

<li>The rest of the list should be the arguments to the Lisp
function, that is, it should contain the data to be acted
upon.</li>
</ul>

Evaluation takes place if Lisp can apply the function to the
arguments. 
<p>Thus,</p>

<pre>
:(ADD 8 3)

  11
</pre>

is a list which is evaluated and has its value printed. 
<p>If the first element is not a Lisp function, then an error
occurs:</p>

<pre>
:(1 2 3 4)

    ** ERROR: BAD ATOMIC ARG **
      EVAL :: NIL

+()

  NIL
</pre>

What if we try to add all the numbers in a list? 
<pre>
:(ADD (1 2))

    ** ERROR: BAD ATOMIC ARG **
      EVAL :: NIL

+()

  NIL
</pre>

Compare the expressions (ADD 1 2) and (ADD (1 2)). In the first
one, the ADD function acts on two separate atoms [not a list--no
surrounding parentheses] while in the second one ADD acts [or at
least tries to act] on a list: (1 2). Remember that Lisp first
evaluates the arguments before applying the function. 
<p>When Lisp encounters (ADD (1 2)), it first tries to evaluate the
argument to ADD, namely the list (1 2). Note that "1" is not a Lisp
function. [Remember, if Lisp is trying to evaluate a lista, the
first element in the list had better be the name of a Lisp function
and the rest of the list had better be the arguments to that
function or else TROUBLE!!]</p>
<a name="nil2"></a>
<p>Here, again, NIL ["()"] is used to get back to the normal Lisp
prompt ":".</p>

<p>We would like to be able to use lists like "(A B C)", to
represent data in Lisp. Unfortunately Lisp seems to want to
evaluate everything that we enter. Since there is likely no "A"
function, the evaluation of the list will cause an error. This
leaves us in a bit of a quagmire!</p>
<a name="quote"></a>
<p>Good fortune has fallen upon you. There is a way to stop Lisp
from trying to evaluate a list. The quote character ['] causes Lisp
to take the expression as written rather than to try to evaluate
it. We're going to begin applying the quote quite liberally from
now on. Be very careful to watch what does and does not get
evaluated.</p>

<pre>
:'(DO NOT (EAT ANYTHING) NOW))

  ( DO NOT (EAT  ( ANYTHING ) NOW  ) )

:'(MULT (ADD 1 2) 4)

  ( MULT (ADD 1  2 ) 4 )
</pre>

<a name="carcdr"></a> Let's introduce some Lisp functions which
manipulate lists. Manipulating involves taking apart, putting
together, and checking the values of lists. The two functions CAR
and CDR are used to get parts out of lists. The CAR function
returns the first element in a list. 
<pre>
:(CAR '(1 2 3 4))

  1

:(CAR '((I HATE) (PEANUT BUTTER) (AND JELLY)))

  ( I HATE )

:(CAR 1)

    ** ERROR: BAD ATOMIC ARG **
      CAR :: (1       )

+()

  NIL
</pre>

Note that the result of a CAR need not be an atom [in the second
case above, it is a list of two atoms], but that CAR is only
designed to take arguments which are lists, not atoms. 
<p>CDR [pronounced "could-er"] is the complement of CAR in that the
result of CDR is the "rest" of the list:</p>

<pre>
:(CDR '(1 2 3 4))

  ( 2 3 4 )

:(CDR '(FUN FROG))

  ( FROG )

:(CDR '((THREE BLIND) MACE))

  ( MACE )

:(CDR '(HELLO))

  NIL

:(CDR '())

  NIL
</pre>

Like CAR, CDR is defined only to operate on lists. Unlike CAR,
however, the value of CDR is ALWAYS a list. Note that the CDR of a
list with only one element is an empty list [written as () or NIL].

<p>We have, in the previous pages, listed the following seemingly
contradictory characteristics of NIL:</p>

<ul>
<li>NIL is an atom.</li>

<li>NIL is a list (as a result of the CDR operation).</li>

<li>NIL means "false" in predicates.</li>

<li>NIL, by name, means "nothing."</li>
</ul>

<p>NIL is certainly making a lot of trouble for such an empty
concept. Why should we make so much ado about nothing? NIL is in
fact the most important entity in the Lisp language. It is both an
atom and a list, depending upon who is doing the asking. It can be
returned by functions whose value is defined to be an atom, such as
a predicate, or by functions whose value is defined to be a list,
such as CDR. NIL is an empty list [a list with no elements]. The
use of NIL will become clearer when we begin studying user defined
functions in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Back to the business at hand: CAR and CDR.</p>

<p>We saw in the first chapter that subexpressions can be used in
place of the arguments of any function. In the same way, the list
processing functions can be combined to do various list
operations.</p>

<pre>
:(CDR '(SAND WITCH))

  ( WITCH )

:(CDR (CDR '(SAND WITCH)))

  NIL

:(CDR (CDR (CDR '(SAND WITCH))))

  NIL

:(CAR (CDR '(SAND WITCH)))

  WITCH

:(CAR (CAR (CDR '(() ((BOZO) ( NO NO))))))

  ( BOZO )

:(CDR (CAR (CDR '(() ((BOZO)  (NO NO))))))

  ( (NO NO ) )

:(CAR (CAR (CDR (CAR (CDR '(() ((BOZO) (NO NO))))))))

  NO

:(CDR (CAR '((CAR CDR) CAR)))

  ( CDR )

:(CAR '(ADD 1 2))

  ADD

:(CDR '(ADD 1 2))

  ( 1 2 )
</pre>

As we mentioned a little earlier in this chapter, the expressions
that we are typing into Lisp are lists, just as "(1 2 3 4)" is a
list. Remember functions and arguments? Well, the CAR of an
expression-list is its function name and the CDR of that
expression-list is the list of the arguments to that function! <a
name="CxxxxR"></a> 
<p>There are standard abbreviations for up to four successive
applications of CAR/CDR combinations: take the letter "A" from
every CAR and "D" from every CDR and place them next to each other
sandwiched between a "C" and an "R" [NOTE: Lisp aficionados claim
to be able to pronounce all 28 combinations of CAR and CDR]. For
example, the expression (CADDR ANYLIST) is the same as the longer
expression (CAR (CDR (CDR ANYLIST))). This book will not use these
too much, but you should be familiar with them since many things
written in Lisp do use them. The above example</p>

<pre>
:(cdr (car (cdr '() ((bozo) (no no))))))
</pre>

could have been written 
<pre>
:(CDADR ' (() ((BOZO) (NO NO))))

  ( (NO NO ) )
</pre>

<h3>Exercises: Car For Yourself</h3>

We still aren't deep enough into Lisp to do any entertaining or
interesting exercises so your task is to make up some exercises for
this chapter and do them.
