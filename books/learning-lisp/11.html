<h2>Simple Recursion</h2>

<em>Recursion</em> occurs when a program calls itself as a help
function. How can a function be defined in terms of itself? That
sounds like a circular definition! 
<p>Recursion avoids circularity by defining the function in terms
of simpler cases of itself. If we keep using the function on
simpler cases, then eventually the function will get to a simple
enough case and as such will know the answer without having to
recur.</p>

<p>Let's try a simple program, called RECITE, to print out all the
elements in a list with one element per line of output. We will do
this by having our function print out the CAR of the list, using
the built-in Lisp function PRINT, and then call itself, recur with
the CDR of the list. Notice that because we are going to pass the
CDR of the list, the list will get smaller with each recursive
call.</p>
<a name="term"></a>
<p>Recursion is useless unless we can make it stop. RECITE,
therefore, should do the following: If its argument is NIL, then it
should return to NIL. [This type of test is called a
<em>termination condition</em>. We need it to keep List from
running away.] If its argument is not a NIL, then print the CAR of
the argument and call RECITE again with the CDR. Here is
RECITE.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (RECITE (LAMBDA (STUFF)

:   (COND ((NULL STUFF) ())

:         (T (PRINT (CAR STUFF))

:            (RECITE (CDR STUFF)))

:     ))))

  RECITE

:(RECITE '(THIS IS A TEST LIST))
  THIS
  IS
  A
  TEST
  LIST

  NIL
</pre>

When STUFF is NIL, the COND evaluates "(null stuff)" to T and
evaluates the "()" as dictated by COND. Otherwise it prints the CAR
of the list and calls RECITE, binding the CDR of STUFF to the new
STUFF. Notice that it does not replace the value of STUFF but
simply binds a new local value to it. When that particular call
terminates, the previous value of STUFF will return. The NIL
displayed at the end is not printed by the PRINT function. Rather,
it is the value returned by the RECITE function. It came from the
succession of recursive function terminations. When the function we
started off with terminates, it prints out its value because there
is no "caller" to return to other than the user. 
<p>What would have happened if we had left out the termination
condition? Answer: no end in sight.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (RECITE (LAMBDA (STUFF)

:   (PRINT (CAR STUFF))

:   (RECITE (CDR STUFF)))))))

  RECITE

:(RECITE '(THIS IS A TEST))
  THIS
  IS
  A
  TEST
  NIL
  NIL
  NIL
  NIL
  NIL
  NIL

+()

  NIL
</pre>

{We hit control C.} <a name="errcontrolc"></a> 
<p>The list of NILs in the above execution will go on forever.
We've cut off at seven in order to preserve our forests. This is a
good time to learn about how to do that--that is, stop a function
that is running wild. The answer is control-C. When a Lisp function
starts repeating, you simply hold CONTROL and hit C. This causes
Lisp to break the function, suspend it, and enter the "+" mode.
[We've talked about this before.]</p>
<a name="member"></a>
<p>Onward to another example. The function we are going to define
is called MEMBER. This function will take two arguments, an atom
and a list. MEMBER will return a T if the atom is one of the
top-level elements of the list, NIL otherwise. We now exhibit the
function definition and some examples of its uses.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (MEMBER (LAMBDA (A L)

:        (COND

:          ((NULL L) NIL)

:            ((EQUAL A (CAR L)) T)

:            (T (MEMBER A (CDR L)))))))

  MEMBER

:(MEMBER 'MAN '(UNION MAN))

  T

:(MEMBER 'SNURD '(ELMER SNERD))

  NIL

:(MEMBER 'A '((A B) C D))

  NIL
</pre>

Here, we first test to see if L is an empty list. If it is, we need
to search no further. We then compare the specified atom A with the
first element of list L. If they are equal, then we have a match
and the value of T is returned. Otherwise, we try again, looking
for the atom in the CDR of the list. Note that this process is
guaranteed to terminate because the function either returns a value
or tries again with a shorter list. A list can only contain a
finite number of elements so that after a maximum number of calls
equal to the number of top-level elements in the initial list, we
must reach an answer. <a name="trace"></a> 
<p>Let's follow the MEMBER function with a debugging tool called
TRACE. The Lisp TRACE function will tell us who calls whom and what
is returned. When you see "<code>--&gt;&gt;</code>", it means that
the function is being called. When you see
"<code>&lt;&lt;--</code>", it indicates that the function is
returning. Follow these examples and watch what's happening. Note
that you get an extra set of parentheses around the arguments in
the "<code>--&gt;&gt;</code>" trace.</p>

<pre>
:(TRACE MEMBER)

  T

:(MEMBER 'ARM '(HEAD LEG ARM FOOT))

   --&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (ARM (HEAD LEG ARM FOOT))
   --&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (ARM (LEG ARM FOOT))
   --&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (ARM (ARM FOOT))
   &lt;&lt;-- MEMBER :: T
   &lt;&lt;-- MEMBER :: T
   &lt;&lt;-- MEMBER :: T
</pre>

Note that the "T" result is passed back through each level of the
recursive call. It isn't just popped right back up to the top from
the last call [the last "<code>--&gt;&gt;</code>"]. 
<p>Let's try one that fails [returns NIL].</p>

<pre>
:(MEMBER 'HAND '(ARM HEAD LEG FOOT))
     -&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (HAND (ARM HEAD LEG
     FOOT ) )
     -&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (HAND (HEAD LEG FOOT )
     )
     -&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (HAND (LEG FOOT ) )
     -&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (HAND (FOOT ) )
     -&gt;&gt; MEMBER :: (HAND NIL )
     &lt;&lt;- MEMBER :: NIL
     &lt;&lt;- MEMBER :: NIL
     &lt;&lt;- MEMBER :: NIL
     &lt;&lt;- MEMBER :: NIL
     &lt;&lt;- MEMBER :: NIL

  NIL
</pre>

The same returning sequence happens with the NIL. In fact, the same
type of thing will always happen in a Lisp function that returns
the values to the routine that called it, never back to the user
directly. We saw this in the ENDS example and it also applies to
recursion.
<a name="untrace"></a>
<p>The opposite of TRACE is UNTRACE.</p>

<pre>
:(UNTRACE MEMBER)

  NIL
</pre>

If you forget to UNTRACE your functions they will keep tracing
themselves until you either restart Lisp, or shut off your
computer. 
<p>If you wish to turn tracing off of all of your functions at
once, simply type (UNTRACE).</p>

<pre>
:(UNTRACE)

  NIL
</pre>

<a name="fact"></a> As a third example, we will look at a recursive
mathematical function, namely, the factorial. Recall that the
factorial of n is the product of the first n integers and is
defined by the following recursive formula: 
<pre>
n! = 1            if n = 0
    n*(n-1)!      if n &gt; 0
</pre>

Notice that the termination condition is already specified in the
definition, namely, that the recursion stops when n=0. The
factorial can easily be defined in Lisp, as follows: 
<pre>
:

:(DEFINE (FACTORIAL (LAMBDA (N)

:   (COND

:   ((EQUAL N 0) 1)

:   (T (MULT N (FACTORIAL (SUB N 1))))

:   ))))

  FACTORIAL

:(FACTORIAL 0)

  1

:(FACTORIAL 1)

  1

:(FACTORIAL 2)

  2

:(FACTORIAL 3)

  6

:(FACTORIAL 5)

  120
</pre>

It would be instructive to trace an evaluation of FACTORIAL to see
how it works. Here's a trace of (FACTORIAL 5). 
<pre>
:(FACTORIAL 5)
     -&gt;&gt; FACTORIAL :: (5 )
     -&gt;&gt; FACTORIAL :: (4 )
     -&gt;&gt; FACTORIAL :: (3 )
     -&gt;&gt; FACTORIAL :: (2 )
     -&gt;&gt; FACTORIAL :: (1 )
     -&gt;&gt; FACTORIAL :: (0 )
     &lt;&lt;- FACTORIAL :: 1
     &lt;&lt;- FACTORIAL :: 1
     &lt;&lt;- FACTORIAL :: 2
     &lt;&lt;- FACTORIAL :: 6
     &lt;&lt;- FACTORIAL :: 24
     &lt;&lt;- FACTORIAL :: 120

  120
</pre>

Notice how each value of FACTORIAL is passed back through every
level of the recursive call, where it is multiplied by the value of
n at that level. Work through the example to be sure you understand
it.
