<h2>The P-Lisp Interpreter</h2>

This chapter is intended for those who are curious about how a Lisp
interpreter manages to do all the wonderful things described in the
previous chapters. The chapter is a bit technical in nature and
assumes the reader has a basic knowledge of bits, bytes, and
similar aspects of computer internals. Although written
specifically about the P-Lisp system, many of the concepts and
methods employed here are used in many different Lisp systems. 
<p>On its most fundamental level, a Lisp interpreter consists of
little more than a set of routines to handle some fancy pointer
manipulation (a pointer being an address of some location in
memory). This simplicity is a direct result of the uniformity of
Lisp data structures. As described below, the primary data
structure, the list, maps quite easily onto an equivalent internal
representation. The interpreter's simplicity is further enhanced by
the non-necessity of a sophisticated parser, due to Lisp's rather
simple syntax. Moreover, because Lisp is by definition a recursive
language, the interpreter may be defined recursively as well,
substantially reducing its complexity.</p>

<a name="cell"></a> 
<p>The P-Lisp workspace is divided into four-byte units called
"cells." The first two bytes of a cell are called (naturally
enough) the CAR of the cell, and the last two bytes are the cell's
CDR. The cells are aligned on contiguous four-byte boundaries, so
that the last two bits of a cell's address are always zero (see
below). This is necessary because the last two bits may then be
used as status flags or to describe a cell's contents.</p>

<pre>
       Cell 0       Cell 1       Cell 2       Cell 3
   --------------------------------------------------------
   ||     |     ||     |     ||     |     ||     |     ||
   || CAR | CDR || CAR | CDR || CAR | CDR || CAR | CDR ||...
   ||     |     ||     |     ||     |     ||     |     ||
   --------------------------------------------------------
Byte 0  1  2  3   4  5  6  7   8  9  A  B   C  D  E  F   10

</pre>

Figure 27.1. Memory Cells 
<p>For example, the CAR or CDR of a cell will typically contain the
address of another cell. Bit 1 of such a pointer is used to
indicate the type of data it is pointing at. If the bit is set, the
pointer (with the bit reset) points to an atom; if the bit is
reset, the pointer points to a list. A list is represented as a
linked list of cells. For example, the list (A B C) is represented
simply as</p>

<pre>
---------     ---------     ---------
|   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |
|   |  -----&gt; |   |  -----&gt; |   |NIL|
| | |   |     | | |   |     | | |   |
--|------     --|------     --|------
  |             |             |
  v             v             v
Pointer       Pointer       Pointer
to A          to B          to C
</pre>

Figure 27.2. List Representation 
<a name="zero"></a>
<p>The CDR of the last box is a pointer to the atom NIL. To make
life easy for the interpreter, NIL is predefined to live at a
location in memory where the hi-byte of its address is guaranteed
to be zero (such an address is said to reside in "page zero" of
memory). So, if the first byte of a pointer is zero, the
interpreter assumes that the pointer points to NIL, regardless of
the value of the second byte.</p>

<p>Note in Figure 27.2 how the list (A B C) maps directly onto its
internal representation. The CAR of (A B C) is A, and the CAR of
the first cell of the list points to the atom A. The CDR of (A B C)
is (B C), and the CDR of the first cell points to the internal
representation of (B C). You should be able to see already that to
evaluate (CAR '(A B C)), for example, the CAR subroutine simply
returns the CAR of the first cell of (A B C).</p>

<a name="literalatom"></a> 
<p>P-Lisp supports three types of atoms: literal atoms, integer
atoms, and floating-point atoms. Literal atoms are stored with the
following format:</p>

<pre>
---------     ---------
|   |   |     |   |   |
|   |  -----&gt; |   |  -----&gt; Pointer to
| | |   |     | | |   |     property list
--|------     --|------     (could be NIL)
  |             |
  v             v
Pointer to    Pointer to
value         print-name list
</pre>

Figure 27.3. Literal Atom<br>
<br>
A literal atom's print name (the sequence of characters comprising
the name of the atom) is stored in a linked list. The CAR of each
cell in this list contains two characters of the atom's name, while
the CDR points to the next cell in the list. The CAR of an atom's
first cell points to the atom's value; if the atom has no value,
this pointer is zero. Note that in the latter case both bytes are
zero; this is necessary to distinguish the no-value case from the
NIL-value case, which has only the hi-byte zero. 
<p>As an example, the atom APPLE with the value FRUIT and the
property list (COLOR RED) would have the following format:</p>

<pre>
---------     ---------     ---------     ---------
|   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |
|   |  -----&gt; |   |  -----&gt; |   |  -----&gt; |   |NIL|
| | |   |     | | |   |     | | |   |     | | |   |
--|------     --|------     --|------     --|------
  |             |             |             |
  v             |             v             v
                |
Pointer to      |           Pointer to    Pointer to
FRUIT           |           COLOR         RED
                v
              ---------     ---------     ---------
              |   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |
              |A P|  -----&gt; |P L|  -----&gt; |E  |NIL|
              |   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |
              ---------     ---------     ---------
</pre>

FIgure 27.4. Literal Atom<br>
<br>
Numeric atoms are distinguished from literal atoms by having the
CDR of the first cell NIL, with the CAR pointing to the remainder
of the atom. An integer atom has the following format: 
<pre>
---------
|   |   |
|   |NIL|
| | |   |
--|------     ---------
  |           |   |   |
  ----------&gt; |   |NIL|
              |   |   |
              ---------
                ^
                |
                |
                --- 16-bit value
</pre>

Figure 27.5. Integer Atom<br>
<br>
The 16-bit value is in two's-complement form. The NIL in the CDR of
the second cell distinguishes integer atoms from floating-point
atoms. A floating-point atom has the following format: 
<pre>
---------
|   |   |
|   |NIL|
| | |   |
--|------      ---------     ---------
  |            | : |   |     |     : |
  -----------&gt; | : |  -----&gt; |     : |
               | : |   |     |     : |
               ---------     ---------
                 ^               ^
                 |               |
                 |               |
               Exponent &amp;     Mantissa &amp;
               mantissa       sign byte
</pre>

Figure 27.6. Floating-point Atom<br>
<br>
Floating-point atoms are stored in unpacked normalized exponential
form. The mantissa is four bytes in length, providing ten
significant digits. 
<a name="oblist"></a>
<p>All literal atoms, including the built-in atoms (T, NIL, and the
built-in functions), are organized into a single list within the
workspace, called the OBLIST. Literal atoms are always unique; for
some atom A, there can be only one instance of A in the workspace.
All references to this atom are pointers to the single location
where A resides. Numeric atoms, however, are not unique; there can
be any number of instances of a given numeric value.</p>
<a name="read"></a>
<p>When the Lisp READ routine reads a s-expr, the s-expr is parsed
and an internal representation of the s-expr is built. For every
literal atom, the interpreter scans the OBLIST for that atom,
comparing the atom's print name to those of the atom on the OBLIST.
If the atom is found, the pointer to the atom (with the atom bit
set) is returned; otherwise, an internal representation of the new
atom is built and added to the end of the OBLIST, and a pointer to
the new atom is returned. If READ reads a numeric atom, it simply
builds a new atom (integerized, if possible) and returns its
pointer. Although unique numeric atoms would provide a substantial
memory savings, vital for any microcomputer implementation, the
result would be a severe degradation of performance in any
application involving extensive calculations (consider that, if
numeric atoms were unique, the OBLIST would have to be scanned
after every calculation to determine if the result already lives on
the OBLIST).</p>

<p>After READ builds the linked list of cells representing the
just-read s-expr, a pointer to the list is passed on to the
evaluator, EVAL. EVAL determines if the s-expr is an atom or a list
by the status of the atom bit. If the bit is set, the s-expr is an
atom, and EVAL evaluates it in the following way: If the atom is
numeric (indicated by the CDR of the first cell being NIL), EVAL
just returns the pointer to the atom as the result. In the case of
a literal atom, EVAL first scans the environment chain (see
discussion on environment chain below) for the atom, and returns
the corresponding value if found. If the atom is not on the chain,
EVAL uses the atom's OBLIST entry, returning the CAR of the first
cell as its value.</p>

<p>If EVAL is handed a list to evaluate, the CAR of the first cell
is used to determine the function to be applied. If the pointer
points to an atom, EVAL scans the property list of the atom for the
EXPR property. If found, the corresponding property value, the
function definition, is evaluated, with the CDR of the first cell
handed to EVAL used as the pointer to the argument list. If EVAL
does not find the EXPR property, the property list is scanned
again, this time searching for the SUBR property. If this property
is found, the corresponding property value is used as the address
of the interpreter subroutine that evaluates this SUBR. This
routine is called, passing to it the pointer to the argument list.
If the CAR of the first cell handed to EVAL points to a list, EVAL
calls itself to evaluate this list, applying the end result of this
evaluation (which must be an EXPR or SUBR) to the argument
list.</p>

<p>The SUBR routines themselves consist primarily of building new
cells, deleting old cells, and moving pointers around. Consider,
for example, the function CONS. Recall that (CONS 'A '(B)) creates
a new list (A B), the CAR of which is A, and the CDR of which is
(B). This is accomplished in the interpreter by simply getting a
new cell and storing the pointer to A in the CAR and the pointer to
(B) in the CDR. The pointer to the new cell now points to the
result, the list (A B).</p>

<p>The environment chain contains the active LAMBDA-bindings during
a given evaluation. LAMBDA-bindings are stored as cell pairs; the
CAR of the first cell points to the formal argument, and the CAR of
the second cell points to the value bound to the formal argument.
The end of the environment is marked by a NIL formal argument, with
the CDR of that cell pointing to the next environment on the chain.
Below is a sample environment chain.</p>

<pre>
---------     ---------     ---------     ---------     ---------
|   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |     |   |   |
|   |  -----&gt; |   |  -----&gt; |   |  -----&gt; |   |  -----&gt; |NIL|   |
| | |   |     | | |   |     | | |   |     | | |   |     |   | | |
--|------     --|------     --|------     --|------     ------|--
  |             |             |             |                 |
  v             v             v             v                 v
Formal X      Value bound   Formal Y      Value bound      Pointer
              to X                        to Y             to next
                                                           environment
</pre>

Figure 27.7. Environment Chain<br>
<br>
Whenever an environment is exited (for example, leaving a PROG or a
LAMBDA-expression), the cells in the environment are discarded and
the environment chain pointer is set to point to the next
environment on the chain. Whenever a new environment is entered (a
new invocation of a LAMBDA-expression or PROG), a new environment
is built and attached to the head of the environment chain. <a
name="garbage"></a> 
<p>During the course of an evaluation, cells are constantly being
used and discarded as required by the interpreter, for example, by
building and discarding environments. Initially, all free cells in
a workspace are organized into a linked list called the free-space
list. New cells are taken from this list as needed by the
interpreter. When the interpreter runs out of new cells, a routine
called the Garbage Collector is invoked. The Garbage Collector
scans the entire workspace, collecting all discarded cells into a
new free-space list. This collection is accomplished in two phases,
the Mark phase and the Sweep phase. During the Mark phase, all
cells that are currently "active," that is, those cells that are
attached to the OBLIST or those that are part of the environment or
the recursion stack, are marked as active. This is done by setting
the garbage collector bit, bit 0, of the CDR of each cell. Cells
that are not marked at the end of the Mark phase cannot be reached
via a pointer path either through the OBLIST, the environment
chain, or the recursion stack; these cells are considered free and
reusable. During the Sweep phase of garbage collection, the free
cells are collected into a new free-spacelist. This is accomplished
by scanning the workspace from top to bottom. All cells that are
marked are simply unmarked, while cells that are initially unmarked
are added to the freespace list. After this phase is completed, the
interpreter continues processing where it left off when the Garbage
Collector was invoked.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

In very broad terms we have described the basic workings of the
P-Lisp interpreter. A more detailed examination would probably be
beyond the scope of this book. However, you should now be able to
reread the tutorial with a better understanding of how and why
things work the way they do. If you wish to know more about the
design of Lisp interpreters in general, John Allen's "Anatomy of
Lisp" is an excellent source for such information.
