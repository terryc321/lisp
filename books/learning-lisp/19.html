<h2>FEXPRS: Unevaluating Functions</h2>

<a name="args"></a> Most of the functions that we've used thus far
are called "EXPRs" [short for EXPRession]. An EXPR is a function
that evaluates its arguments when it is called. ADD, MULT, CAR,
CONS, and many others are all EXPRs. <a name="fexpr"></a> 
<p>It is often useful to be able to write a function whose
arguments will not be evaluated but rather, passed as is to the
function. A function that does not evaluate its arguments is called
a "FEXPR".</p>

<p>The first flexibility that this offers us is that we can type
things in without quotes. The pig Latin example could have been
simplified with a FEXPR. We could have typed</p>

<pre>
(PIGLATIN THIS IS A TEST SENTENCE)
</pre>

instead of 
<pre>
(PIGLATIN '(THIS IS A TEST SENTENCE))
</pre>

<a name="flambda"></a> 
<p>A FEXPR has a slightly different DEFINE syntax than an EXPR. The
word LAMBDA is replaced by the word FLAMBDA. There is exactly one
formal argument, never more, never less:</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (PRINTME (FLAMBDA (INPUT)

:        INPUT))))

  PRINTME
</pre>

We have defined a trivial function in order to return the value
that gets bound to its formal argument. This will enable us to see
what a FEXPR does with the arguments: 
<pre>
:(PRINTME I HAVE BUT ONE LIST FOR YOU)

  (I HAVE BUT ONE LIST FOR YOU )
</pre>

The FEXPR simply makes a list of the unevaluated arguments and
binds this to the single formal argument. 
<pre>
:(PRINTME (CAR (BUS)) (CDR (CADDR CDDAR)))

  ((CAR (BUS ) ) (CDR (CADDR CDDAR ) ) )
</pre>

The CAR and CDR functions above are not evaluated. As far as the
FEXPR is concerned they are simply names exactly like "bus",
"truck", "caddr", etc. 
<p>Now let's do something less trivial. Notice that PRINTME always
puts an extra set of parentheses around its argument.</p>

<pre>
:(PRINTME LIBERTY)

  (LIBERTY )

:(PRINTME (OR DEATH))

  (OR DEATH ) )
</pre>

Here's a version of PRINTME that doesn't do that. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (PRINTME2 (FLAMBDA (INPUT)

:   (CAR INPUT)))))))

  PRINTME2
</pre>
<a name="quote"></a>
Now PRINTME2 acts exactly like the QUOTE function that we have
encountered in our Lisp studies. In fact, this is exactly what the
quote (') sign does. When we put a quote before a list or an atom,
it is interpreted as if we had typed "(QUOTE . . .)". QUOTE is a
FEXPR that returns the name of its argument unevaluated. 
<pre>
:'(CAR (DONT EVALUATE THIS))

  (CAR (DONT EVALUATE THIS ) )

:(PRINTME2 (CAR (DONT EVEN TRY)))

  (CAR (DONT EVEN TRY ) )

:(QUOTE (CAR (DONT EVALUATE THIS)))

  (CAR (DONT EVALUATE THIS ) )
</pre>

Knowing this might be of some relief to those of you who have
noticed that when an error occurs, Lisp has expanded the
apostrophes into the word QUOTE. 
<a name="setq"></a>
<p>So, there has been at least one FEXPR with us since the
beginning. Can you think of others? How about SETQ? Why doesn't the
first argument in SETQ need a quote? [Why do you think that they
call it SETQ?!] Wherever it seems as though something should be
quoted but is actually not necessary, there's probably a FEXPR in
the works someplace.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that a FEXPR should always call an EXPR
to do the work. It can typically do this by using MAPCAR to scan
the list of input elements. Using this rule we can rewrite PIGLATIN
as,</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (PIGLATIN (FLAMBDA (SENT)

:   (MAPCAR 'PIGWORD SENT)))))))

  PIGLATIN
</pre>

You should try this and verify that it works as expected. You
should be able to type in the sentence to be translated, without
parentheses or the quote. 
<p>The other advantage that FEXPR gives us is the ability to write
functions that take an unspecified number of arguments. For
example, we might want to write a function that takes a list of
paired names and phone numbers, and returns each pair in list
form.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (PAIRWISE (FLAMBDA (IN)

:    (SEGMENT IN)))))))))

  PAIRWISE

:(DEFINE (SEGMENT (LAMBDA (L)

: (COND ((NULL L) ())

:  (T (CONS (LIST (CAR L) (CAR (CDR L)))

:    (SEGMENT (CDR (CDR L)))))))))

  SEGMENT

:(PAIRWISE A 1 B 2 C 3 D 4)

  ((A 1 ) (B 2 ) (C 3 ) (D 4 ) )
</pre>

There is another important rule of FEXPR's: Never recur with a
FEXPR, and avoid calling them from within other functions. Why is
that? Consider what the result of calling a FEXPR recursively will
do. Let's define a recursive FEXPR. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (REVLIST (FLAMBDA (L)

:  (COND ((NULL L) ())

:  (T (CONS (REVERSE (CAR L))

:            (REVLIST (CDR L))))))))

  REVLIST
</pre>

This should reverse each element of the input list. Thus, we should
be able to type 
<pre>
(revlist (him rebuild) (was he than better))
</pre>

and get 
<pre>
((rebuild him) (better than he was))
</pre>

in response.
<a name="trace"></a>
<p>It would be nice to be able to TRACE FEXPRs but P-Lisp can't.
Other versions of Lisp may or may not allow this. However, for this
example, we'll imagine that it can and imagine that it will
print.</p>

<pre>
:(revlist (him rebuild) (was he than better))
  --&gt;&gt; REVLIST :: ((HIM REBUILD) (WAS HE THAN BETTER))
  --&gt;&gt; REVLIST :: ((CDR L))
  --&gt;&gt; REVLIST :: ((CDR L))
  --&gt;&gt; REVLIST :: ((CDR L))
+()
</pre>

The first list went in okay, but it looks like the recursive steps
didn't work correctly. Since the FEXPR doesn't evaluate its
arguments, the "(cdr L)" wasn't evaluated, and the next iteration
simply tried to do REVLIST on "(cdr L)" as opposed to the CDR of
"L". This would have gone on forever if we hadn't interrupted.
Actually, Lisp has a large but finite recursion limit. You will
undoubtedly encounter RECURSION CHECK errors eventually. That's
what really happens if you let a recursive function run away. 
<h3>Exercises Not to Be Evaluated</h3>

<ol>
<li>Write REVLIST correctly. You'll probably want to use a help
function.</li>

<li>Is DEFINE a FEXPR? Of course, it is, otherwise we wouldn't have
asked the question. Convince yourself with the argument just
presented.</li>
</ol>
