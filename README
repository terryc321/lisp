An attempt to follow gholoum incremental compiler paper.

Demos
*****************************************************

 100doors - 100doors open and closing puzzle , leads to sequence of square numbers 
 queens   - n queens puzzle
 

Motivation
*****************************************************
With all the drawbacks , when it works , it works surprisingly well.

queens puzzle runs in about 3 seconds equivalent to what mit-scheme compiled bench file seems to do.
so its a respectable compiler for these toy programs.



Technical Overview
********************

The heart of the compiler is located in STEP034
  ../compiler/step034/ 

  simulator-comp.scm  =  generates x86 opcodes in s expression format
    mainly in the hope that peep hole optimiser might 
	  
Theres no register allocator , but its interesting to see how it would help.

All the primitives are OPEN CODED , theres not much thought put into them just a simple set of
x86 operations i knew would work and slapped them in .




LET local bindings
*******************************
Let assigns items to stack , does not create a closure.


Assignment conversion MISSING - set! is not handled yet , so that means no LETRECs .
*******************************
LETRECs are can be macro expanded as SET! and LETs 
I had an idea that if the only functions are toplevel , ie no function nesting ,
then there is no point in having closures because any free variable must either be undefined - ie wrong program
or its a toplevel variable , and these arent captured in closures anyway because toplevel is always available.


Complex Quoted Expressions MISSING
***********************************
this isnt a problem , was able to get a similar system to have pre-built list structure in NASM file which meant
zero startup time , rather than CONSing something together then doing whatever runtime should do .



Garbage Collector MISSING
***************************
This is MILD NIGGLE in general, it stops long running computations .

List structured memory - is cute for lisp s expressions , but it does not work for vectors which require
continuous memory regions.

Bump and two finger algorithm seems a good choice.


New DataTypes
****************
New datatypes affect the Garbage Collector because it has to be aware of structure of the type , what is
and is not a pointer to some other object.


PROCEDURE CALLS work.
**********************

si means stack index - the first FREE SLOT to save into using MOV

rule 1 :  PRESERVE stack index 

that means nothing like these commands in the generated code
  PUSH DWORD EAX      -- alters ESP ruins indexing
  POP DWORD EBX  -- alters ESP ruins indexing 
  ADD DWORD ESP , 4 -- alters ESP ruins indexing
  SUB DWORD ESP , 4 -- alters ESP ruins indexing

must not alter the ESP register directly or indirectly unless DOING the procedure call
in which case

rule 2 :  PRESERVE esi HEAP alignment to multiple of 8 

  ADD ESI , 8   -- clean simple and safe bump

  misaligned HEAP leads to fantastically wild bugs like in a single file
  fib and factorial were defined - calling fib procedure would call the factorial - i kid ye not.


TAIL CALLS work - tricky to get right , requires good nights sleep and a clear head to write.
*********************************************************************************************

figuring out the required offsets , noting that SI stack index grows downwards and other issues
makes it difficult problem.

tail calls compile correctly by evaluating the new arguments ,
collapsing the stack and doing a JMP.

The simple compiler is not smart enough yet to tell when it is a tail call , so have a special form
  (tailcall (f ... ))

I dont think this is a big issue to fix , maybe just detect when last item in an implicit begin
sequence should be a tailcall .

But primitives in tail call position are not tailcalls - confusing eh.
, so theres that to be aware of also .

maybe (primitive-call + ... ...) so we can tell when something is a primitive or not ?.
