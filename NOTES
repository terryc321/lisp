is it possible to detect tail calls ?




****************************************************************


compiler takes a very simplistic view of program

either
toplevel definition - procedure takes a fixed number of args  , no rest args

(define f (lambda (a b c) ...))

applications are coded as calls to f after arguments have been put on stack




****************************************************************

tak x y z

compile x
save x
compile y
save y
compile z
save z
call or jmp to TAK


****************************************************************

compilation of primitive cons

(cons A B)

compile A
save A
compile B
do cons primitive

CPS-INTERPRETER / STEP013 contains really basic x86 32bit scheme compiler

Main hurdle has been to realise that C compiler is NOT suitable for detailed memory
mangling - rather the c compiler is SO COMPLEX that it is not practical to do anything ,
because its all random flags, rather than clean semantics.

if coming up against problems , write utility in assembler and it should fix the issue.

There is a test suite in python3
cd cps-interpreter/step013/
then run ./test.py

should state all tests PASS

Type TAG Pointer Encoding Scheme is a little FUNKY , but works as long as understand
limitations of C compiler.
****************************************************************

scheme compiler in file called comp.scm

At the moment , it only handles a few basic primitives

add1
sub1
+	addition fixnums
-	subtract fixnums
cons
car
cdr
eq?
null?


fixnums encoded in pointer
pairs stored on the heap , again pairs encoded using tag of 1
all pointers have 3 bit type tag

 tags
 000  - number lower 2 bits zero 
 001  - pointer
 010  -    vectors  * to do *
 011  -    strings  * to do *
 100  - number lower 2 bits zero
 101  -    symbols  * to do *
 110  -    closures  * to do *
 111  -  empty list , booleans and characters


********************************************************************************


the best part is under CPS-INTERPRETER directory

there is a file called repl.scm
load this into mit-scheme

********************************************************************************
SICP Register Machine 

special forms : IF , LAMBDA , QUOTE , SET! , BEGIN ,  

A macro expander is available.
Quasiquote expander requires list and append.

********************************************************************************
that should pull in all the required defmacro expander and quasiquote.

at the moment macro expansion is handled outside of the lisp interpreter ,
so lisp interpreter only sees a few core forms ,
dont ask me what they are i think i forgot
 LET
 IF
 SET!
 LAMBDA 

could of done away with LET using
 ((lambda let-vars  ... let body ....) ... let-arguments ... )
 but then i just see a SEA of LAMBDAs and have no idea whats going on.

then i think that really many more CORE forms , makes debugging easier because culprit
is easy to identify , whereas if its all macro expanded out ,
maybe need to track where that expression came from.

because the interpreter , the evaluator anyway is in CPS , call/cc is a simple two liner .


other things
 COND = macro expands into 
 


also thinking of a way to play connect4 , but that went quiet for a time.
thought about lists , but WAY too slow.
nice idea about assignment to SYMBOLS , seems fairly fast ,
mutating board coupled with alpha beta search .
none of that works for sure though....




what follows is just rambling 
********************************************************************************

6th March 2017  -- main focus is cps-interpreter/  directory
it has a repl , macro expander , quasiquote capability



lisp
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

subject		:	algorithm		*	implemented ?
*******************************************************************************
quasiquote
bawden algorithm to expand quasiquote
can be included as part of macro system
naive defmacro expansion algorithm implements usual culprits
let let* letrec cond when unless
	
kohlbecker
try achieve hygenic macros by renaming

macro stepper
want to be able to step through macro expansion process one step at a time

tokeniser
keep track of source line column offset locations of tokens in file stream , repl whatever.

parser
generate s expression of stream of tokens
if it is not possible invoke fail continuation

debug program
high priority want to know how and when the program got to this point
forth i dont think has an environment
backus fp uses streams and again rejected the environment

core.scm	:	core syntax of scheme and required primitives
quote
if
lambda
set

gensym	; some way generate unique symbols

derived.scm	:	derived syntax in terms of core
let		; evaluate all expressions then form environment extended then evaluate body
let*		; evaluate let expressions one by one extending environment as each is evaluated
letrec		; 

environment	:
problematic printing environment because likely it is circular in places.


cps-conversion
convert expression into continuation passing style
bugs -
excess lambdas
does not handle derived syntax

macros
choose expand macros at run-time slow , or at compile time , or on first pass.

when macro
(when condition ....)

compiler

quoted expressions
if access to memory model of machine can lay out complex quoted expressions beforehand
so running the program is already built with these things laid out in memory

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
