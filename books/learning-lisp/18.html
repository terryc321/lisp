<h2>Isplay Ogrammingpray</h2>

You now have all the tools needed to solve some reasonably large
problems in Lisp. [You've actually had most of them for a while.]
This chapter demonstrates the steps that can be taken to solve such
problems. These steps are, of course, dependent upon the exact
problem specified, but there are some general rules which we will
emphasize. 
<a name="system"></a>
<p>The problems we will attack are those of a pig Latin translator.
The system [a collection of functions and help functions all
intented to solve one problem] will take a sentence in English and
return the sentence in pig Latin. It will do this:</p>

<pre>
:(PIGLATIN '(TAKE OUT THE TRASH)))

  (AKETAY OUTWAY ETHAY ASHTRAY )
</pre>

The first step in designing a system is: Take out a piece of paper
and a pen or pencil. 
<p>You will need paper to keep notes [and doodle while you think].
If the system will have many functions in it you're definitely
going to need a scorecard to keep track of the functions and their
arguments. Because of the environment nature of Lisp, it's not easy
to comment the functions so notes are important!</p>
<a name="spec"></a>
<p>Next, define the problem and lay out exact specifications.</p>

<p>In this case, the specifications are fairly easy. The user will
enter his sentence as a list of words, and the program will return
the sentence with each word "pigized".</p>
<a name="pigalgo"></a>
<p>The next step is to decide on an algorithm.</p>

<p>The standard pig Latin algorithm works in the following
manner.</p>

<p>Look at each word in the sentence. If its first letter is a
vowel, simply add "way" to it. Otherwise, remove all the letters
from the beginning of the word, and up to the first vowel. Put them
after the word. Then add "ay".</p>

<a name="ass"></a> 
<p>There are a few assumptions in this description. It is very
important to specify your assumptions so that you know which cases
you won't have to deal with. A well-defined set of assumptions can
make a programming task quite a bit simpler.</p>

<p>We have assumed that all words have vowels in them. We will
ignore the case of "words" (actually syllables) with no vowels.
Also, we assume that only vowels can be one-letter words ("a",
"I"). By examining some sample cases, we can fill in blanks in the
algorithms.</p>

<pre>
WATER --&gt; ATERWAY
WEEPS --&gt; EEPSWAY
</pre>

<p>Thus, "W" is not a vowel.</p>

<pre>
YELLOW --&gt; YELLOWAY
YAKS --&gt; YAKSWAY
</pre>

<p>So "Y" is a vowel. Obviously, "A", "E", "I", "O", and "U" are
vowels also.</p>

<a name="mapcar"></a> 
<p>We've now specified the problem. How do we go about programming
it? The most useful technique to learn is called top down
programming. It means that the main programs are written before the
help functions. By using the top down style we can organize our
thoughts. Let's start at the very beginning. The first part of the
algorithm says: "Look at each word in the sentence." Because our
sentence is a list, the words are the atoms in that list. Looking
at each word is similar to the MAPCAR operator. Let's define our
main function to use MAPCAR and cause each word in the sentence to
be processed.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (PIGLATIN (LAMBDA (SENTENCE)

:  (MAPCAR 'PIGWORD SENTENCE)))))

  PIGLATIN
</pre>

<a name="name"></a> This is the main function. There are two
important factors to note in the definition of this function. The
first is its name [and the name of the help function it calls] have
meaning. We could have called this function "xyzzy" but then we
would never be able to remember what it did! <a name="help"></a> 
<p>The second point is more subtle. The main function and all the
functions that we'll write are very short. We took a single idea
[mapping down the sentence] and turned it into a function. The help
function [PIGWORD] will also implement one little part of the
whole. By slowly adding parts of the algorithm, we can build the
entire system in very small, easily manageable increments. There
are many advantages to this, not the least of which is that simpler
and smaller functions are easier to edit or retype.</p>

<p>Let's get on to the first help function: the processing of each
word. The PIGWORD function will take a word and turn it into pig
Latin. The I/O [Input/Output] behavior of this function should
be</p>

<pre>
:(PIGWORD 'THIS)

  ISTHAY
</pre>

There's a problem here. We have functions that modify lists but not
functions for modifying the letters in an atom. The solution is to
make the atom a list and then turn the processed list back into an
atom: 
<pre>
THIS -&gt; (T H I S) -&gt; (I S T H A Y) -&gt; ISTHAY
</pre>

<a name="explodeimplode"></a> 
<p>Of course, Lisp conveniently provides functions for doing this.
EXPLODE turns an atom into a list of its letters, and IMPLODE does
the opposite.</p>

<p>Here we have a new concept not specified in the algorithm, but
implicit in the nature of Lisp. We need to have some intermediate
processing step that does this explosion, and subsequent implosion.
We will define PIGWORD as follows:</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (PIGWORD (LAMBDA (WORD)

:    (IMPLODE (PIGLISTEDWORD (EXPLODE WORD)))

:    )))

  PIGWORD
</pre>

PIGLATIN calls PIGWORD via MAPCAR and passes it to each word.
PIGWORD, in turn, explodes the word and processes it using another
help function [with a meaningful name] called PIGLISTEDWORD.
PIGLISTEDWORD will return the list of the "pigized" word, and
PIGWORD will implode it to an atom again and return the new word to
PIGLATIN. 
<p>All that remains now is write PIGLISTEDWORD. Which part of the
problem does this one implement? Here is the definition.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (PIGLISTEDWORD (LAMBDA (WORD)

:  (COND

:    ((ISAVOWEL (CAR WORD)) (PIGVOWEL WORD))

:    (T (PIGNOVOWEL WORD))))))

  PIGLISTEDWORD
</pre>

Several things are still missing from the system. PIGVOWEL will
translate a word that starts with a vowel into its pig Latin
equivalent. PIGNOVOWEL will translate all other words, and the
predicate ISAVOWEL will tell us whether the letter it received is a
vowel or not. 
<p>Let's write the simple ones first:</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (ISAVOWEL (LAMBDA (LETTER)

:   (MEMBER LETTER '(A E I O U Y))))

:)

  ISAVOWEL

:(DEFINE (PIGVOWEL (LAMBDA (WORD)

:   (CONC WORD '(W A Y))))))

  PIGVOWEL

:(PIGVOWEL '(A F T E R))))

  (A F T E R W A Y )
</pre>

We should now be able to test the simple part of the
system--sentences where all the words begin with a vowel. 
<pre>
:(PIGLATIN '(ALERT AIRMEN ARE ONTIME))

  (ALERTWAY AIRMENWAY AREWAY ONTIMEWAY )
</pre>

[What would happen if we tried to "pigize" a sentence with words
that began with consonants? Try it.] 
<p>Great! Most of our system finished in only 5 functions. All we
have to do now is write the hard one. PIGNOVOWEL. Let's describe
the responsibility of that function in detail.</p>

<p>Since we can only deal with one letter of the exploded word at a
time, we have to search for the first vowel [ISAVOWEL will be
useful here]. When we find the vowel, we will attach the first
letters [which we will have been collecting up along the way] to
the end of the word and tack on an "ay".</p>

<p>How can we recur down a list and keep the information as we go?
The answer is to pass the list of collected letters along with the
recursion, and just tack on letters along the way. This is the
function. Follow it by hand, and see what it does.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (PIGNOVOWEL (LAMBDA (WORD LETS)

:  (COND

:    ((ISAVOWEL (CAR WORD))

:       (CONC WORD (CONC LETS '(A Y))))

:    (T (PIGNOVOWEL (CDR WORD) (APPEND LETS (CAR WORD))))))))

  PIGNOVOWEL
</pre>

Note that there are two arguments to this function. We will always
have to supply both of them, or this function will not work. O.K.,
let's try it out: 
<pre>
:(PIGNOVOWEL '(T H I S) ())

  (ISTHAY)
</pre>

That looks good, we should now be able to try the whole system: 
<pre>
:(PIGLATIN '(EVERY GOOD BOY DOES FINE))

  ** ERROR: TOO FEW ARGS **
  PIGNOVOWEL :: (WORD)

+()

  NIL
</pre>

Oops! Something went wrong. The error message said we called
PIGNOVOWEL with one argument instead of two. The call was from
PIGLISTEDWORD. We hadn't forseen that we'd need two arguments in
PIGNOVOWEL when we wrote PIGLISTEDWORD. Oh well, we can now go and
edit it or retype it. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (PIGLISTEDWORD (LAMBDA (WORD)

:  (COND

:    ((ISAVOWEL (CAR WORD)) (PIGNOVOWEL WORD))

:    (T (PIGNOVOWEL WORD NIL))))))

  PIGLISTEDWORD


:(PIGLATIN '(STICKS AND STONES ARE PAINFUL))

  (ICKSTAY ANDWAY ONESSTAY AREWAY AINFULPAY)
</pre>

Looks good! 
<p>We've now completed the design of our pig Latin system to
specification. You should SAVE it so that you can recover it
later.</p>

<a name="algospec"></a> 
<p>The lessons of this chapter are summarized in the following
list:</p>

<ul>
<li><a name="form"></a>Take notes. Write down every function and
its "form of call". The form of call for ADD, for example, is:
"(ADD number1 number2)". Also, write one line describing what is
does and what it comes back with. If you're brave you can write
down the function definition. This will help you figure out what's
wrong.</li>

<li>Formulate a complete specification of the problem before
beginning to even think in Lisp. The I/O behavior of the function
should be the main part of this description. I/O behavior also is a
good way to formulate the descriptions of most help functions.</li>

<li>Define the algorithm and assumptions [restrictions] involved.
This will save you from embarrassing trouble later, when you
suddenly remember something that you had forgotten.</li>

<li><a name="top"></a>Use top down programming. That is, start with
the function that the user will type in (think of the user as
someone other than yourself), then fill in your undefined functions
as you get to them. Work your way deeper and deeper into the help
functions.</li>

<li>As you write parts of the system, test the help functions
thoroughly. This will save you debugging time in the long run.</li>

<li><a name="name2"></a>Use mnemonic names. The names of all
functions, help functions, and variables should have meaning to you
and to others. [CAR and CDR are good examples of what not to use as
names.]</li>

<li>Keep your functions brief. Short functions are easier to edit
and easier to retype.</li>

<li>Implement a single part of the algorithm in each function. This
will also help keep them brief. If the algorithm is well described,
then there should be approximately one function per clause in the
description.</li>

<li><a name="consist"></a>Make sure that the parts of the system
are internally consistent. [This is what went wrong with the
arguments of PIGNOVOWEL.]</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Designing a system in Lisp or any other programming
language, is like designing in general. You take it step by step
and fill in the unknowns when you come across them. Always have the
final goal in mind.</strong></p>

<h3>Exercises to Translate Into Thoughts</h3>

<ol>
<li>Explain how a function that sorts words in a list would work.
Think about each function and describe the entire system in
English.</li>

<li>Practice taking a paper and pencil [or pen] out before starting
to write things into Lisp. Do this until it becomes automatic.</li>

<li>There is a simplification that can be made in our Pig Latin
system. It is possible to do it without a function because its
action is performed by a special use of another function. What are
we talking about? Fix the system accordingly. Think about the
advantages and, especially, the disadvantages of doing things this
way.</li>

<li>How is top down programming like recursive tree traversal?
Design a Lisp system [in English but with possible real help
functions] that would take a problem specification. Write the
program using top down tree traversal.</li>

<li>Adjust the pig Latin translator to work with words such as,
"nth", "cwm" and "crwth".</li>
</ol>

<h3>Answers</h3>
