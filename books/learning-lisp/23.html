<h2>Differentiating Polynomials</h2>

We are now going to travel back in time to the days of freshman
calculus. We are going to write a system which will perform
symbolic differentiation of polynomials. 
<p>Here are the rules for differentiation which will use.</p>

<pre>
D[0,x]=0
D[x,x]=1
D[(u+v),x]=D[u,x]+D[v,x]
D[(u-v),x]=D[u,x]-D[v,x]
D[(uv),x]=uD[v,x]+vD[u,x]
D[(u<sup>n</sup>),x]=nu<sup>n-1</sup>D[u,x]
</pre>

<p>We are using the capital letter "D" to indicate the
differentiation operator. Also, we specify the variable with which
the differentiation is being done. Notice that some of these rules
are recursive. For example, in order to differentiate (u+v) we need
to differentiate <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>. So much for the
specification problem. <a name="polypre"></a>Let's recall the
representation of polynomials in Lisp from previous chapters, where
polynomials were transformed into Lisp lists. Thus, "2x" translates
to "(MULT 2 X)", etc. We are going to write some help functions
which return the different parts of the polynomials for use in our
derivative function. We will need the outermost [or highest level]
function in a polynomial. Here is a picture.</p>

<pre>
(ADD (MULT 2 X) 3)

             second term
     first term
top-level function
</pre>

<p>Here are some of our help functions. The "function" in a
polynomial is the CAR of the polynomial represented in Lisp. The
first and second terms of a polynomial are the CADR and the CADDR
of the Lisp representations, respectively.</p>

<pre>
:(define (function (lambda (poly)
:        (car poly) )))
  FUNCTION
:(define (firstterm (lambda (poly)
:        (cadr poly) )))
  FIRSTTERM
:(define (secondterm (lambda (poly)
:        (caddr poly) )))
  SECONDTERM
:(setq p '(add (sub x 2) 12))
  (ADD (SUB X 2) 12)
:(function p)
  ADD
:(firstterm p)
  (SUB X 2)
:(secondterm p)
  12
</pre>

<p>Note that none of these functions are strictly necessary.
However, if we were to change the underlying Lisp representation
then it would only be necessary to change these three functions. If
we didn't use them, then any change in the representation would
require changing every access of the representation in all of the
functions we write.</p>

<p>Let's write the main function first. It will be called DERV and
take two arguments: a polynomial, and the variable with which the
polynomial is to be differentiated. Here is some sample
behavior.</p>

<pre>
:(derv '(add x 2) 'x)
  (ADD 1 0)
:(derv '(mult x 2) 'x)
  (ADD (MULT X 0) (MULT 2 1))
:(derv '(exp x 2) 'x)
  (MULT (MULT 2 (EXP X 1)) 1)
</pre>

We now exhibit the function DERV. 
<pre>
:(define (derv (lambda (poly var)
:        (cond
:             ((atom poly) (dervatom poly var))
:             ((equal 'add (function poly))
:                        (dervsum poly var))
:             ((equal 'sub (function poly))
:                          (dervminus poly var))
:             ((equal 'mult (function poly))
:                        (dervprod poly var))
:             ((equal 'exp (function poly))
:                          (dervexp poly var))
:        ))))
  DERV
</pre>

<p>If the polynomial is an atom then we call a help function,
DERVATOM, which will properly differentiate an atom. We will write
DERVATOM shortly. The next four conditions compare the main
function in the polynomial with the different functions we are
using: ADD, SUB, MULT, and EXP. If one of those four are found, the
appropriate help function is called.</p>

<p>Let's write DERVATOM. The derivative of an atom is equal to 1 if
the atom is the variable with which the differentiation is being
performed. The derivative is a 0 in all other cases. This function
is quite simple to write.</p>

<pre>
:(define (dervatom (lambda (poly var)
:       (cond
:            ((equal poly var) 1)
:            (t 0)))))
  DERVATOM
:(derv '1 'x)
  0
:(derv 'x 'x)
  1
</pre>

<p>We will now write the function for differentiating a sum of two
polynomials.</p>

<pre>
:(define (dervsum (lambda (poly var)
:        (list 'add
:        (derv (firstterm poly) var)
:        (derv (secondterm poly) var) ))))
  DERVSUM
:(dervsum '(add x 3) 'x)
  (ADD 1 0)
</pre>

<p>Notice that DERVSUM, which is called by DERV, also calls DERV.
Therefore, we have a PAIR of recursive functions.</p>

<p>Similarly, here is the function for differentiating a difference
of two polynomials.</p>

<pre>
:(define (dervminus (lambda (poly var)
:        (list 'sub
:              (derv (firstterm poly) var)
:              (derv (secondterm poly) var)))))
  DERVMINUS
</pre>

<p>The functions for multiplication and exponentiation are only
slightly more difficult.</p>

<pre>
:(define (dervprod (lambda (poly var)
:        (list 'add
:              (list 'mult
:                    (firstterm poly)
:                    (derv (secondterm poly) var) )
:              (list 'mult
:                    (secondterm poly)
:                    (derv (firstterm poly) var)) ))))
  DERVPROD
:(define (dervexp (lambda (poly var)
:        (list 'mult
:              (list 'mult
:                    (secondterm poly)
:                    (list 'exp
:                          (firstterm poly)
:                          (sub (secondterm poly) 1)) )
:                    (derv (firstterm poly) var) ) )))
  DERVEXP
:(dervprod '(mult x 2) 'x)
  (ADD (MULT X 0) (MULT 2 1))
:(dervexp '(exp x 2) 'x)
  (MULT (MULT 2 (EXP X 1)) 1)
</pre>

<p>We now have the entire system, so let's try some difficult
stuff.</p>

<pre>
:(derv '(add (mult 3 (exp x 2)) 15 'x)
  (ADD (ADD (MULT 3 (MULT (MULT 2 (EXP X 1)) 1))
  (MULT (EXP X 2) 0)) 0)
:(derv '(add (add (mult a (exp x 2)) (mult b x)) c) 'x)
  (ADD (ADD (ADD (MULT A (MULT (MULT 2 (EXP X 1)) 1))
  (MULT (EXP X 2) 0)) (ADD (MULT B 1) (MULT X 0))
  0) 0)
:(setq a (derv '(mult (add x 1) (sub 1 x)) 'x))
  (ADD (MULT (ADD X 1) (SUB 0 1)) (MULT (SUB 1 X)
  (ADD 1 0)))
:(setq x 3)
  3
:(eval a)
  -6
