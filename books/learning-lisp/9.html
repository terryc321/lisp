<h2>This Thing Called Lambda</h2>
<a name="lambda"></a>
All the functions that were defined previously had something called
LAMBDA in them. We left this without explanation up to now. Here
we'll take a deeper look at the LAMBDA function and what it does.
<a name="define"></a> 
<p>Functions are always defined in the following form:</p>

<p>(DEFINE (name (LAMBDA (formal arguments) function-expression
)))</p>

<p>"Name" is the name of the function being defined. This shouldn't
cause any trouble. "Function-expression" is simply the expression
that will be evaluated when we invoke the named function. We've
been here before, right? When you type "(name . . .)" Lisp
evaluates: "(function-expression)". That was how we got FIRST to do
a CAR function. Whenever "(first . . .)" was entered, Lisp replaced
it with its defined function-expression, "(car . . .)".</p>

<a name="args"></a> 
<p>"Formal arguments" serve to hold the place for the actual
value[s] which will be inserted when the function is evaluated. As
you will recall from previous chapters, we had a formal argument
[L] in the FIRST function. We couldn't get the value of L outside
of the function. The "function-expression" can use L, but we can't!
Why is that?</p>

<p>Let's look again at the function FIRST.</p>

<pre>
(define (first (lambda (L)
(car L) )))
</pre>

Now, let's invoke FIRST. 
<pre>
:(FIRST '(A B C))

  A
</pre>

This is the same result we would have gotten if we had instead done

<pre>
:(SETQ L '(A B C))

  (A B C )

:(CAR L)

  A
</pre>

except that if we had done that, the value of L would still have
been available after the CAR operation. It seems that the formal
arguments got SETQed to match the supplied argument when the
function was invoked. The only difference is that after the
function finishes [that is, the function-expression is done
evaluating] the values get unSETQed. <a name="errinter"></a> 
<p>If the function has an error that causes an interrupt [you get
an error message and get a "+" prompt], then it hasn't finished
evaluation yet, and the values assigned to the formal arguments are
still there. That is why we can look at them when we have the "+"
prompt. When we tell Lisp to terminate the function that was
suspended by entering a NIL to the "+", then it terminates the
function and, POOF, the values that were in our formal arguments
are gone.</p>

<p>To be a little more specific, the supplied arguments in the
calling expression are matched with the formal arguments. Then the
values of the supplied arguments are inserted into the function
expression where their associated formal arguments were. This is
subsequently evaluated in place of the original expression.</p>
<a name="lambdalist"></a>
<p>Now let's discuss some variations on this theme. If there had
been two variables in the formal argument list ["(L m)" for
example], then we would have to put two variables in the part of
the expression supplied with arguments. It should be pointed out
that the names in the formal argument list [also known as the
"lambda list"] are completely arbitrary. "L" and "M" might just as
easily have been "LOVESICK" and "MOOSE", as long as we did the same
in the function-expression also.</p>

<p>As an example of a two-argument function, here is a function
that concatenates two lists together. We are calling it MERGE:</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (MERGE (LAMBDA (L M)

:       (CONC L M))))

  MERGE

:(MERGE '(A B C) '(D E F))

  (A B C D E F )
</pre>

The first supplied argument would be bound [CONC is short for
CONCatenate] to the first name "L" and the second would be bound to
the name "m". 
<pre>
( (a b c) (d e f) )
-------------------
(    L       m    )
</pre>

<p>Let's try giving Lisp nothing to connect to the formal
argument:</p>

<pre>
:(FIRST)

    ** ERROR: TOO FEW ARGS **
      FIRST :: NIL

+()

  NIL
</pre>

Oops! Well, that should have been expected. FIRST had one formal
argument and we supplied none, so it told us that we had too few.
Now the error reports should be slightly more meaningful to you. 
<p>Can you figure out what would happen if we had typed "(first '(a
b c '(d e f))"? Try it.</p>

<a name="bind"></a> 
<p>The process of assigning the values of the supplied arguments to
the formal arguments is called <em>Lambda-Binding</em>. The
arguments in the "lambda-list" [the formal arguments] are called
<em>locals</em>. They are "local" to the function in which they are
bound in that when the function ends, the binding comes apart, and
L [in the case of FIRST] no longer has the value it had inside the
function. That is why we can't see the value in L after the
function has ended.</p>

<p>The process of Lambda Binding is an important concept in Lisp.
We will discuss its mechanisms in detail later on. For the time
being it is important that you understand what it appears to do to
variables.</p>
