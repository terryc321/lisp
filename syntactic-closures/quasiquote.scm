;;
;; Assumed that some more primitive Lisp parser
;; has already read in the quasiquotation to be expanded.
;; and has somehow tagged all the quasiquotation markup.
;; This primitive parser must supply the following four functions
;;
;; tag-backquote?
;; this predicate should be true of the result of reading a backquote (`)
;; followed by an s expression 
;;
;; tag-comma?
;; this predicate should be true of the result of reading a comma (,)
;; followed by an s expression
;;
;; tag-comma-atsign?
;; this predicate should be true of the result of reading a comma-atsign (,@)
;; followed by an s expression
;;
;; tag-data
;; this function should be applied to an object that
;; satisfies one of the previous three predicates
;; it will return the s expression that followed the quasiquotation markup
;;
;; The main entry point is the function qq-expand which should be applied to an
;; expression that immediately followed a backquote character.
;; ie the outermost backquote tag should be stripped off BEFORE qq-expand
;; is called.
;; 
;; Code created by qq-expand and qq-expand-list performs all list construction
;; by using either append or list.  It must NEVER use CONS.  This is important
;; in order to make nested quasiquotations using splicing work properly.

;; The code generated here is correct but inefficient.  In a real lisp
;; implementation some optimization would need to be done.  Care must be taken not
;; to perform any optimizations that alter the behaviour of nested splicing.
