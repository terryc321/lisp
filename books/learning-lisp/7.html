<h2>Help Functions</h2>

<a name="builtin"></a> The functions we defined in preceding
chapters used functions such as CAR and CDR. These functions are
called built-ins. A built-in function is nothing mysterious. All
the built-in functions are just the same as your own functions
[like FIRST]. In fact, once you define a function, it becomes
built-in until you leave Lisp. The only difference between
built-ins that you build in and those that are built in by Lisp is
that the latter are defined automatically each time you enter Lisp.
<a name="help"></a> 
<p>A built-in that you build into Lisp [like FIRST] is called a
<em>help function</em>. We call these help-functions because we can
use them to write other functions that do bigger and better things.
[We could use them to do smaller and worse things, but that isn't
any fun.]</p>

<p>Let's write a function called ENDS which takes the first and
last elements from a list and returns them as a new list. To begin
with, let's redefine FIRST and LAST, since, unless you saved your
workspace the last time, they are not there any more.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (FIRST (LAMBDA (L)

:      (CAR L))))))

  FIRST

:(DEFINE (LAST (LAMBDA (L)

:        (CAR (REVERSE L)))))

  LAST
</pre>

Okay, now we define ENDS which uses FIRST and LAST as
help-functions. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (ENDS (LAMBDA (L)

:        (CONC (FIRST L) (LAST L))))))

  ENDS
</pre>

We'll try it out. 
<pre>
:(SETQ INPUTLIST '(GRATEFUL ARE THOSE WHO

:ARE NOT DEAD))

  (GRATEFUL ARE THOSE WHO ARE NOT DEAD )

:(ENDS INPUTLIST)

    ** ERROR: BAD LIST ARG **
      CONC :: ((FIRST L ) (LAST L ) )

+L

  (GRATEFUL ARE THOSE WHO ARE NOT DEAD )

+(FIRST L)

  GRATEFUL

+(LAST L)

  DEAD

+()

  NIL

:(FIRST L)

    ** ERROR: UNDEFINED ATOM **
      EVAL :: L

+()

  NIL
</pre>

<a name="errsusp"></a> When Lisp comes back with the "+" prompt, then
the function we are executing [which was ENDS] is
<em>suspended</em>. This means that it has been stopped in
mid-evaluation due to some error. At this time, the formal argument
"L" has the value intact. We can look at its value and also use it
in other functions while ENDS is still suspended. You know ENDS is
still suspended because you still get the "+" prompt. After you
type the "()", the suspension is cleared, and the formal argument
is gone. Let's look at the error report to see if we can find the
problem with ENDS. Both FIRST and LAST successfully return values,
so they are not the problem. Aha!! CONC takes as arguments two
lists, not two atoms! The following is an example: 
<pre>
:(CONC 'GRATEFUL 'DEAD)

    ** ERROR: BAD LIST ARG **
      CONC :: ((QUOTE GRATEFUL ) (QUOTE
      DEAD ) )

+()

  NIL
</pre>

It looks like we'll have to figure out some way of making a list
with the results of FIRST and LAST. 
<p>How can we make an atom into a list? Think about what CONC does
to the parentheses and about what we want the result to look like.
Given "anatom" we want to see "(anatom)". We learned that the CONS
function puts something into the beginning of a list. We can simply
use CONS to put the atom into a NIL list. Do you see that this will
give us the result that we need? If not, try it in Lisp.</p>

<p>Now that we have figured out what the problem was, how do we fix
up poor old ENDS? Why not write another help-function called
MAKELIST that puts parentheses around the result of FIRST and LAST
for us.</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (MAKELIST (LAMBDA (ATOM)

:        (CONS ATOM NIL))))

  MAKELIST
</pre>

Try it out. 
<pre>
:(MAKELIST 'DEADHEAD)

  (DEADHEAD )
</pre>

Okay, that looks good. Now all we have to do is change ENDS to use
MAKELIST as a help-function. [Note the proliferation of
help-functions. It's better to have a lot of help-functions than
not enough.] 
<a name="list"></a>
<pre>
:(DEFINE (ENDS (LAMBDA (L)

:   (CONC (MAKELIST (FIRST L)) (MAKELIST

:(LAST L))))))))

  ENDS

:(ENDS '( I CANT BELIEVE I ATE THE WHOLE

:THINK)))

  (I THINK )

:(ENDS INPUTLIST)

  (GRATEFUL DEAD )
</pre>

How about that! It worked! It should be pointed out that Lisp
already has a function called LIST which does exactly what MAKELIST
does. We did it ourselves just for practise. 
<p>A suggestion: Go back through what we just did. Type it all into
the computer and carefully follow every step. We'll talk more about
figuring out what happens when a function goes wrong [a process
called <em>debugging</em>], and about changing help-functions [a
process called <em>editing</em>] in later chapters. For now, just
understand what went wrong and how we fixed it.</p>

<p>The important concept in this chapter was the use of
help-functions to make the job of other functions easier. Never be
afraid to write a help function to perform some little task for
you. As with the simple function definition in the last chapter,
they can help you to organize your thoughts by naming mental jobs
into understandable parts.</p>
