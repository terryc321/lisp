<h2>The Conditional</h2>

<a name="cond"></a> This chapter deals with conditional expressions
in Lisp. Conditions are used commonly in English: "If you're a bad
boy then you'll be sent to bed without dinner". 
<p>The conditional above has two parts: a test, "you're a bad boy",
and a statement which will result if the test is true, "you'll be
sent to bed without dinner".</p>

<a name="nil"></a>
<p>Here is a set of examples in Lisp:</p>

<pre>
:(COND (T '(HI THERE)) (NIL 'THEIR HIGH))
:))

  (HI THERE )

:(COND (NIL '(THEIR HIGH)) (T '(HI THERE
:))))

  (HI THERE )

:(COND (T '(THEIR HIGH)) (T '(HI THERE))))

  (THEIR HIGH )
</pre>
COND takes as its arguments a set of lists. Suppose, for the sake
of explanation, we use: 
<p>(cond list1 list2)</p>

COND will evaluate the CAR as LIST1. If the result is not a NIL,
then COND will evaluate the remaining things in the list, and will
return the value of the last thing it evaluated. If the result is
NILL, COND will go on and do the same thing for LIST2. 
<a name="t"></a>
<p>In the first example above, the first list is "(t '(hi there))".
The CAR of the expression is T, which evaluates to T. Following the
process described above, COND notes that the value T does not equal
NIL, and therefore evaluates the rest of the list. Its value is
"(hi there)" which is what is returned. The second example shows
the case where the first list is not evaluated but the second is.
The CAR of the first list evaluates to NIL so that list is skipped.
The CAR of the second list is T, so the rest is evaluated. Not too
bad so far, eh?</p>

<p>If both the first and the second CARs are true, then because
COND starts at the beginning and works its way down [since the CAR
of the first list evaluates to "T"], COND will never get to the
second list. The second list will never be evaluated!! When COND
can't find a list with a non-NIL CAR, then it returns a NIL.</p>

<pre>
:(COND (NIL '(FALSEHOOD)) (NIL '(FALSETTO

:))))

  NIL
</pre>

COND will work for any number of lists, not just two. 
<pre>
:(COND (NIL '(DOOR #1)) (NIL'(DOOR #2))

:(T '(DOOR #5)))))

  (DOOR #5 )
</pre>

Okay, the party is over, and now we put COND to work. Above, we
used the values of T and NIL, because they evaluate to themselves.
However, COND becomes a much more powerful tool when predicates are
used as the first elements of the conditional lists. 
<p>The definition of the absolute value function can be described
as: If the number is positive, then return the number. Otherwise,
return the number's negative.</p>

<p>Note that this successfully "catches" zero, since the negative
of zero is still zero.</p>

<p>The equivalent Lisp function can be written:</p>

<pre>
:(DEFINE (ABS (LAMBDA (N)

:        (COND

:           ((GREATER N 0) N)

:           (T (MULT N -1)))))))

  ABS

:(ABS 3)

  3

:(ABS -453)

  453

:(ABS 0)

  0
</pre>

Here is a non-numerical function which uses COND. Make sure you
understand the evaluation of the function. 
<pre>
:(DEFINE (MAKE-A-LIST (LAMBDA (A-LIST)

:  (COND

:    ((ATOM A-LIST) (CONS A-LIST NIL))

:      (T A-LIST))))))

  MAKE-A-LIST

:(MAKE-A-LIST 'HAPPY)

  (HAPPY )

:(MAKE-A-LIST '(LISP LISP LISP))

  (LISP LISP LISP )

:
</pre>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li>Write a function that returns T if its first argument is less
than or equal to its second argument, and NIL otherwise.</li>

<li>Write a function that compares two 2-atom lists, returning T if
both lists are the same (assume EQUAL only works on atoms).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Answers</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<pre>
(DEFINE (LEQ (LAMBDA (N1 N2)
  (COND
   ((EQUAL N1 N2) T)
   ((GREATER N2 N1) T)
   (T NIL)
  )
)))
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<pre>
(DEFINE (COMPARE (LAMBDA (L1 L2)
  (COND
    ((EQUAL (CAR L1) (CAR L2))
     (COND
       ((EQUAL ((CADR L1) (CADR L2)) T)
       (T NIL)
     )
    (T NIL)
  ))
)))
</pre>
