<h2>Simplifying Polynomials</h2>

Let us now return once again to the world of polynomials. We have
only one task remaining, namely the simplification of a polynomial.
Remember from the last episode that the result of the DERV function
could be rather messy, as the following aptly demonstrates: 
<pre>
:(derv '(mult (add x 2) (add x 3)) 'x)
  (ADD (MULT (ADD X 2) (ADD 1 0)) (MULT (ADD X 3)
  (ADD 1 0)))
</pre>

<p>There is no intelligence in the DERV function. It should be
clear that (MULT (ADD X 2) (ADD 1 0)) can be simplified to (ADD X
2). In fact, there are many similar simplifications that can be
performed on polynomials. Here is our list.</p>

<pre>
Lisp form      Simplified form
---------      ---------------
MULT ? 0              0
MULT 0 ?              0
MULT 1 ?              ?
MULT ? 1              ?
ADD 0 ?               ?
ADD ? 0               ?
SUB ? 0               ?
EXP ? 0               1
EXP ? 1               ?
EXP 0 ?               0
EXP 1 ?               1

[where ? is any Lisp expression]
</pre>

<p>Assume we have at our disposal a function called SIMPLIFY which
will perform these transformations. Here is some behavior.</p>

<pre>
:(simplify '(add x 0))
  X
:(simplify '(exp 0 0))
  1
:(simplify '(mult (mult 0 x) y))
  0
:(setq p (derv '(mult (add x 2) (add x 3)) 'x))
  (ADD (MULT (ADD X 2) (ADD 1 0)) (MULT (ADD X 3)
  (ADD 1 0)))
:(simplify p)
  (ADD (ADD X 2) (ADD X 3))
</pre>

<p>When we apply the SIMPLIFY function to an expression of the form
MULT 1 ?, the result should be the result of applying SIMPLIFY to
?. This means that SIMPLIFY is recursive.</p>

<p>The following function implements the above table:</p>

<pre>
:(define (simplify1 (lambda (poly)
:  (cond
:       ((null poly) nil)
:       ((atom poly) poly)
:       ((equal 'mult (function poly))
:         (cond
:       ((equal 0 (firstterm poly)) 0)
:       ((equal 0 (secondterm poly)) 0)
:       ((equal 1 (firstterm poly))
:                       (simplify1 (secondterm poly)))
:       ((equal 1 (secondterm poly))
:                       (simplify1 (firstterm poly)))
:       (t (list 'mult
:                (simplify1 (firstterm poly))
:                (simplify1 (secondterm poly)))) ))
:   ((equal 'add (function poly))
:       (cond             ((equal 0 (firstterm poly))
:                       (simplify1 (secondterm poly)))
:         ((equal 0 (secondterm poly))
:                       (simplify1 (firstterm poly)))
:                (t (list 'add
:                              (simplify1 (firstterm poly))
:                              (simplify1 (secondterm poly)))) ))
:   ((equal 'sub (function poly))
:       (cond
:         ((equal 0 (secondterm poly))
:                      (simplify1 (firstterm poly)))
:           (t (list 'sub
:                    (simplify1 (firstterm poly))
:                    (simplify1 (secondterm poly)))) ))
:   ((equal 'exp (function poly))
:       (cond
:         ((equal 0 (secondterm poly)) 1)
:         ((equal 1 (secondterm poly))
:                       (simplify1 (firstterm poly)))
:         ((equal 0 (firstterm poly)) 0)
:         ((equal 1 (firstterm poly)) 1) ))
:   (t poly) ))))
  SIMPLIFY1
</pre>
<a name="func"></a>
<p>SIMPLIFY1 uses some of the help functions from the last chapter.
The structure of the function closely follows the list of
semplifications given above. Notice the recursive calls when the
terms are not constant.</p>

<p>Let's compare it with our idealized SIMPLIFY.</p>

<pre>
:(simplify1 '(mult (add x 2) (add 1 0)))
  (MULT (ADD X 2) 1)
:(simplify '(mult (add x 2) (add 1 0)))
  (ADD X 2)
</pre>

<p>We have here a discrepancy. What is the source of the problem?
Well, when SIMPLIFY1 simplifies (ADD 1 0), it gets 1 as it should.
However, the test for multiplication by 1 has already been
performed before this. SIMPLIFY1 can't make the second
semplification. If we view the polynomial as a tree, then SIMPLIFY1
is moving down the tree and any reduction performed on subtrees
can't migrate back to the upper levels. How can we beat this
conundrum? What we really want to do is to keep applying SIMPLIFY1
to the polynomial until the application no longer results in any
change. Let's write a function which goes around in a loop while
continually applying SIMPLIFY1 until a final constant expression is
reached.</p>
<a name="prog"></a>
<p>This is one of those cases, when recursion isn't the easiest way
to do things. Thus, let's use a PROG! The following is the PROG for
SIMPLIFY:</p>

<pre>
:(define (simplify (lambda (poly)
:        (prog (poly1)
:        loop (setq poly1 (simplify1 poly))
:             (cond ((equal poly poly1)) (return poly)))
:             (setq poly poly1)
:             (go loop) ))))
  SIMPLIFY
:(simplify '(mult (add x 2) (add 1 0)))
  (ADD X 2)
</pre>

<p>This function continues to simplify the polynomial until there
is no change between two successive simplifications. It then
returns the simplified polynomial.</p>
