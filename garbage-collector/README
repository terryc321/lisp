simple mark sweep garbage collector

start with initial set of roots
recursively iterate over reachable set
until each reachable object has been marked live
then all other objects can be garbage collected

implicit assumption that each object is understood and
somehow the system knows the difference between
pointers and if that pointer is to an object in heap
or some random value that is pushed onto the stack

implicit assumption theres a stack also, not sure why.
